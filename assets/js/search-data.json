Now let’s think about what we can deduce assuming we know $C$ and $D$. It may seem silly but if we know $C \\land D$ then we know $C$. So we have the following elimination rule for deduction . The notation we use for this move is $\\land_{E_L}$. Similarly, we have the right-sided analog. Then we have a introduction rule that mirrors: if we know that $C$ is true and $D$ is true, then we know that $C$ and $D$ is true. Note that at this level we know very little. For example, $A \\land B \\land C$ is ambigious. It is either \\((A \\land B) \\land C\\) or \\(A \\land (B \\land C)\\) But these are logically equivalent, meaning we can prove one from the other and vice-versa.

One case for when $A$ is true and one case for when $B$ is true. This means that elimination needs to take in a proof $A \\vdash C$ and $B \\vdash C$. Note the lines above $A$ and $B$. This an example of hypothetical reasoning. We have assumed that $A$ is true and provided some argument to derive $C$. Similarly, we have assumed that $B$ is true and argued to $C$.

It has two elimination rules depending on whether we know $X$ or $Y$. If we have a proofs $X \\vdash Y$ and $Y \\vdash X$ then we can conclude $X \\leftrightarrow Y$. Let’s do an example proof to see how these rules interact. Example. Let’s show that \\((A \\to B) \\land (B \\to C) \\vdash A \\to C\\) So if $A$ implies and $B$ implies $C$, then $A$ implies $C$ if we intrepret it using words. Proof. (Expand to view) To prove $A \\to C$, we want introduce a $\\to$. This introduce says we can conclude $A \\to C$ if we can establish $A \\vdash C$. Thus, we can reduce to proving $$ (A \\to B) \\land (B \\to C), A \\vdash C $$ With $A$ and $A \\to B$, we can eliminate to $B$. Then with $B$ and $B \\to C$, we can eliminate to $C$. Below is a full proof. &#9632; . Here is another example. Example. Let’s establish \\(((A \\lor B) \\to C) \\to ((A \\to C) \\land (B \\to C))\\) . Proof.

We \"backwards\" similarly to the last example. To establish a goal of the form $X \\to Y$, we need $X \\vdash Y$. So it suffices to show $$ ((A \\lor B) \\to C) \\vdash ((A \\to C) \\land (B \\to C)) $$ Now to establish a goal with $\\land$ we want to prove both sides of the $\\land$. So we need two proofs $$ (A \\lor B) \\to C \\vdash A \\to C \\\\ (A \\lor B) \\to C \\vdash B \\to C $$ Again we can reverse the introduction rule for $\\to$ to reduce to $$ (A \\lor B) \\to C, A \\vdash C \\\\ (A \\lor B) \\to C, B \\vdash C $$ We can use the introduction rules for $\\lor$ to produce $A \\lor B$ from either $A$ or $B$.

    "content": "The operations we use to combine expressions will reflect oft-occuring structures in human reason. But, we also need to model the common steps in deduction. Here there are two separate roles: assumptions we are given and goals we want to establish (if we can). In the written (or natural) language, you might see. Example. If $n$ and $m$ are even integers, then so is $n-m$. Recall here that the integers are \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\lbrace \\ldots, -2,-1,0,1,2, \\ldots \\rbrace\\) . This could also be written as . Example. Let $n$ and $m$ be even integers. The integer $n-m$ is also an even integer. While the latter example is not written an explicit if-then the content is the same. Our set of assumptions is $n$ and $m$ are even integers while our goal is $n-m$ is an even integer. Let’s write down a proof of these statements. We can represent as a table. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n, m$ even | $n-m$ is even | . Mathematics is well-known for compact (and difficult) notation. In a proof, it is often valuable to unfold the definitions into the statement they represent. We perform this operation on the assumptions. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m$ is even | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ |   | . We also rewrite the goal in the same way. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ |   | . To achieve our goal, we want to exhibit the desired $e$ using the assumptions at hand. To make progress, we import another “known fact” into the assumptions context: distribution of multiplication over subtraction. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ |   | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ |   | . Now we can an apply distribution with $u = 2, v = c, w = d$ to gain another statement and finish. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ |   | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ |   | . | $n - m = 2c - 2d = 2(c-d)$ |   | . | set $e = c-d$ |   | . | $n -m = 2e$ |   | . While we modeled this proof as a table, it is notationally simpler to represent deduction from assumption $A$ to goal $B$ (with some intermediate steps) vertically. And we write $A \\vdash B$ to indicate that we can prove the goal(s) $B$ given the assumption(s) $A$. ",

    "content": "Human reason follows some basic patterns. The truth of one statement is often connected to the truth of another statement. For example, let’s take the following example. Example. If it is cloudy outside, then I don’t need my sunglasses. To understand the content of this course, the first thing we need to do is disentangle our thought a bit. There are two closely related but distinct facets of this example. There is the truth of the statement. Is it actually cloudy outside or not? Do I actually need sunglasses or not? Whether or not someone actually needs their sunglasses probably depends on the person and the level of cloudiness. In focusing on the truth of a statement, we care about the semantics of the proposition. Distinctly, we can also view this statement as built up from basic “atoms” using well-defined rules. In our semantic analysis, we already have broken it down into two separate statements that can either be truth or false in principal: . $A$. It is cloudy outside . $B$. I don’t need my sunglasses . Our example statement is built up from $A$ and $B$ via a if-then construction. It then makes sense to denote it by $A \\Rightarrow B$. The fancy arrow $\\Rightarrow$ stands in for the if-then. Thus, symbolically we have $A$ and $B$ and $\\Rightarrow$ provides a way to connect them to make a new formal symbol \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) . Symbolically, $A$ and $B$ have no infused meaning so why do we even consider this? . Because symbolic manipulation can be incredibly powerful. It can streamline human thought. It can be mechanized in a computer program. It can be converted in a game. For mathematicians, logical reasoning is especially important. When reasoning about intricate structures, it is incredibly easy to make a mistake. The history of mathematics is rich with such examples. To help minimize errors, mathematicians grounded their arguments in logical deduction and fostered a culture of rigorous proofs. Let’s look at a more mathematical example. Recall that \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\lbrace 0,1,2,\\ldots \\rbrace\\) is the set of natural numbers. A natural number $n$ is even if it can be written as $n = 2m$ for some other natural number $m$. A number is odd if is not even. Example. Let $n$ be a natural number. If $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd. t If we denote . $A$. $n$ is even. $B$. $n+1$ is odd. then symbolically we can represent the statement as before \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) But semantically this if very different than our cloudy/sunglasses example above. We start by introducing the basic structure of logical argument. ",

To motivate our rules we have often replaced our symbols $A,B,C,$… by actual statements, eg “the sun is out”. “The sun is out” can either be true or false – we just look outside. So at a very basic level this provides a way to assign either T or F to a propositional variable. We could of course willy-nilly assign T and F for each our propositional variables. But all of our connectives have familiar interpretation in the context of T/F values. | Not true better be false and vice-versa. So \\(\\neg T \\mapsto F \\ , \\ \\neg F \\mapsto T.\\) We can put this into a table: | . | $A$ | $\\neg A$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | . This expresses the values of $\\neg A$ given the values of $A$. | Suppose I know that $A \\to B$ and we know that is $A$ is $T$. It would make a lot sense to conclude that $B$ should also be assigned $T$. But if we allow ourselves to look at possible assignments it makes sense to assign T/F values to each expression using T/F and $\\to$. We can make another table where we list the values assigned to $A$ along the first column and the values assigned to $B$ in the first row. | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\to B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | . One can read this as saying the implication is itself is true if either assumption is false or both the assumption and conclusion are true. | We also have a table for $\\land$ | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\land B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . which says that $A \\land B$ should only be true if both $A$ and $B$ are. | And we have a table for $\\lor$ | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\lor B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . which says $A \\lor B$ is false only when both $A$ and $B$ are. | We also want \\(\\top \\mapsto T \\\\ \\bot \\mapsto F\\) | . Using these rules, once we have a chosse of T/F, we can assign T/F to any propositional formula. Let’s look at a more complicated formula. Example. Let’s take the formula \\(\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D\\) and the truth assignment \\(A, C \\mapsto T, \\ B, D \\mapsto F\\) . It convenient notation to “plug in” to the formula the values of $T$ and $F$. This gives \\(\\neg T \\lor F \\to T \\land \\neg F\\) Then use our rules above to simplify down to a single value. First the negation \\(F \\lor F \\to T \\land T\\) Then the $\\lor$ and $\\land$ \\(F \\to T\\) Finally for $\\to$ we reduce to $T$. Different assignments for $A,B,C,D$ can yield a different value for our formula. For example, if \\(B, C, D \\mapsto T, \\ A \\mapsto F\\) Then \\(\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D \\mapsto F\\) . We can think of the possible truth value assignments to our collection of propositional variables as different possible universes. For example, if $A$ is standing for “the sun is out”, then $A \\mapsto T$ is saying we know the sun it out while $A \\mapsto F$ is saying the sun is not out. So any real-world or mathematical possibility can be found by listing out all the possible T/F assignments and the values taken by the formula given that assignment. Below is a table for our example . The truth table for our example. (Expand to view) | $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $D$ | $\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | .

    "title": "Negation",
    "content": "In a debate or a courtroom, there are usually two opposing sides. One is arguing for $A$ and the other is arguing for not $A$. In propositional logic, we introduce a symbol in the place of not: negation. It is denoted by $\\neg$. Given a formula $A$, then we can make a new one $\\neg A$. But what should be the rules of inference that mimic our arguments involving not? When have I established not of a statement? What does knowing the negation of a statement allow me to conclude? . One common pattern is to start an argument with $A$ and reason until you reach something that is clearly not true. This leads us to also introduce a symbol $\\bot$ which plays the role of false or “this is crazy”. Then we can formalize our pattern of argument via the following introduction rule for $\\neg$ . Given an argument assuming $A$ that leads to an absurdity, then we can conclude $\\neg A$. To eliminate $\\neg$ we have . If both $\\neg A$ and $A$ hold, then this is absurd. What are the rules for introducing and eliminating $\\bot$? We actually just saw the $\\bot$-introduction above – it doubles as the $\\neg$-elimination rule. The elimination rule is very general. Once we have established $\\bot$, then we are free to reach any conclusion. Let’s do another example to see how our rules of deduction interact. Example. Let’s establish \\(\\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg (A \\lor B)\\) . Recall this is shorthand for $ \\vdash (\\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg(A \\lor B))$. In words, this says we can establish $ \\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg (A \\lor B)$ with no assumptions. Proof. (Expand to view) If we want to establish a conclusion of the form $X \\to Y$ then we will want to introduce $\\to$. To do that we need to provide a deduction of the form $$ X \\vdash Y $$ In our case, we want to fill in the details for $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B \\vdash \\neg(A \\lor B) $$ Now our goal is of the form $\\neg Z$ so we want to introduce $\\neg$. To do that, we need to supply a proof of $\\bot$ from $Z$. We have reduced to establishing $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, A \\lor B \\vdash \\bot $$ We could combine $A$ and $\\neg A$, if we had them, to got $\\bot$. The same holds for $B$ and $\\neg B$. ee can eliminate $\\neg A \\land \\neg B$ into either $\\neg A$ or $\\neg B$. For $A \\lor B$ elimination, we need proofs of desired conclusion, here $\\bot$, one with $A$ $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, A \\vdash \\bot $$ and one with $B$ $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, B \\vdash \\bot $$ The proofs of these are quicker. Putting everything together, we get the following natural deduction proof. In step${}^0$, we cancel the assumption $\\neg A \\land \\neg B$ to introduce $\\to$. In step${}^1$, we cancel the assumption $A \\lor B$ to introduce $\\neg (A \\lor B)$ since our conclusion is $\\bot$. Finally the steps${}^2$, we cancel $A$ and $B$ using or elimination. The numerical labels are convenient to keep track of the cancellations. Note that all assumptions are cancelled. &#9632; . Ok so what is the value of this result? It gives a method of proof that holds no matter how we interpret $A$ and $B$. For example, if we say $A$ is “it is hot out” and $B$ is “it is raining”, then we can interpret the above as saying “if I know that the either it is not hot out or it is not raining, then I can conclude that it is not both hot and sunny”. Each of formula that we can prove symbolically is an argument pattern that can be applied in any context. ",

    "title": "Proof vs truth",
    "content": "There are now two distinct categories of validity of a logical statement. | Can we find a (natural deduction) proof $X \\vdash Y$? | For any truth assignment that makes $X \\mapsto T$, must $Y \\mapsto T$? | . Finding a proof is an explicit set of moves to go from $X$ to $Y$ while truth assignments are somewhat external to $X$ and $Y$ but it turns out that the these two notion are closely related. As such we will given the second notion some notation, we will write $X \\models Y$ if for any truth assignment whenever $X \\mapsto T$ then $Y \\mapsto T$ also. We can check this via a truth table. Example. Let’s take \\(X = (A \\to B) \\land A \\ , \\ Y = B\\) . Then we have . | $A$ | $B$ | $(A \\to B) \\land A$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . and can see that when $B$ is true so is $(A \\to B) \\land A$. So \\((A \\to B) \\land A \\models B\\) . But, we also know that \\((A \\to B) \\land A \\vdash B\\) from the proof . The proof above is very close to $\\to$ elimination. Indeed, that is the last set. It is easy to see that \\((A \\to B), A \\models B\\) . This means that whenever we apply $\\to$ elimination, we also have $\\models$ at that step in the proof. We come to our first real mathematical theorem. Theorem. Let $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ and $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$ be collections of formulas in proposition logic. If we know that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\vdash Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) then \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\models Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) . With the example above and the accompanying discussion, this might not be so surprising. A natural deduction proof is built from the elimination and introduction rules listed in the previous sections. One just needs to check that all of these rules don’t break $\\models$. At the moment, we content ourselves with this sketch of a proof. It should be enough to leaving your favoring the validity of the theorem but it falls short of a full mathematical proof. This theorem goes by the name of soundness of propositional logic. But, wait, there is more. Theorem. Let $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ and $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$ be collections of formulas in proposition logic. If we know that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\models Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) then \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\vdash Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) . In fact, you can somehow conjure a proof from the aether just from knowing whenever $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ get assigned $T$, then so does $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$. This is usually called the completeness of propositional logic. A proof this result is beyond the scope of the course but it depends on using the law of the excluded middle (or reductio ad absurdum as they are equivalent. One approach is to break it into a giant collection of cases coming from $A \\lor \\neg A$ for each variable $A$.) . Theorems in mathematics ideally should provide deeper understanding and new tools to address old questions. One question we haven’t really broached but it immediate: how do I know when it is impossible to prove $Y$ with assumptions $X$? . Going straight from the defintion of a natural deduction proof, we would have to test all possible combinations of introduction/elimination rules. Not great. However, from soundness, if we can find a single truth assignment with $X \\mapsto T$ but $Y \\mapsto F$, then we can immediately conclude that $X \\not \\vdash Y$, ie that it is impossible to prove $Y$ from $X$. Example. Let’s show that we cannot prove $\\neg A \\land B \\to C$ from $A \\to B, \\neg C$. Let’s take $A \\mapsto F, B \\to T$, and $C \\to F$. Then \\(A \\to B, \\neg C \\mapsto T\\) while \\(\\neg A \\land B \\to C \\mapsto F\\) If we had $A \\to B, C \\vdash \\neg A \\land B \\to C$, then from the theorem above we could conclude that $A \\to B, C \\vdash \\neg A \\land B \\to C$. We have arrived now at an absurdity. Our calculation shows that $X \\not \\models Y$ but our argument shows that $X \\models Y$. We might be worried for second but then we remember the argument started out with an assumption: that we had a proof! The only way to avoid the absurdity for there not be a proof. In this example, you can see the basic moves in propositional logic being employed in a real-life mathematical example. ",

    "content": "Suppose I can establish an absurdity by assuming the negation of something. What does this give us? Well, given $\\neg A \\vdash \\bot$, we can prove $\\neg \\neg A$. If we that the sun is not not up, that usually means that it is actually up, right? . More formally, we want to know about jutisfying \\(\\neg \\neg A \\vdash A\\) Can this be done using the rules so far? . Unfortunately, nothing in our rules so far will allow us establish this. Adding this rule to our existing system yields some very useful conclusions. For example, given $\\neg A \\vdash \\bot$, we already knew we could establish $\\vdash \\neg \\neg A$ but now we also have $\\vdash A$. The process of establishing $A$ by assuming $A$ doesn’t hold and arguing to a contradiction goes by the Reductio ad absurdum (RAA) or proof by contradiction. Another well-known conclusion is the Law of the Excluded Middle which is just \\(A \\lor \\neg A\\) In other words, no matter what $A$ is either $A$ holds or it is doesn’t. You might take a moment and think this an immutable law of reality. Our day-to-day experience definitely leads us to think this. But reality in general is more complicated. Think of Schrodinger’s cat. Is the cat alive or not alive in the box? What is the state of the unobserved wave function? . But in an idealized world proof by contradiction is a perfectly reasonable assumption. And mathematicians, for the most part, tend to idealize our world. Below is a proof the Law of Excluded Middle using proof by contradiction. Given an formula of the form $A \\to B$, the contrapositive is the formula \\(\\neg B \\to \\neg A\\) . Let’s justify \\(A \\to B \\vdash \\neg B \\to \\neg A\\) . Below is a natural deduction proof . If we substitute $\\neg B$ for $A$ and $\\neg A$ for $B$, we immediately have \\(\\neg B \\to \\neg A \\vdash (\\neg \\neg A) \\to (\\neg \\neg B)\\) With proof by contradiction, we get \\(\\neg B \\to \\neg A \\vdash A \\to B\\) . Establishing the contrapositive and deducing the original statement is uncommonly common pattern in mathematical argument. ",

You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors. When talking with the SHS nurse, be sure to ask for documentation of the consult as you will need this to document why you missed class. You will also use the COVID-19 Student Report Form if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if you have been ordered to quarantine because of close contact with a person who was COVID-19 positive.

I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don’t mind letting you work independently at all. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 5 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. If symptoms persist on the fifth day, then the isolation must be extended to 10 days. What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

    "content": "We delve much deeper into propositional (and other kinds of) logic. While we will talk about one more form of logic (first order or predicate logic), we want to get to using our new logical skills on mathematical questions. As such, let’s end the module on propositional logic with a list of useful and/or well-known provable formulas. Below $A,B,C$ are general formula. | \\(A \\land B \\leftrightarrow B \\land A\\) When we can exchange the placement of an operation taking two inputs (binary operation), then we say it is commutative. This is saying that $\\land$ is commutative (up to bi-implication). | $\\lor$ is commutative : \\(A \\lor B \\leftrightarrow B \\lor A\\) | \\((A \\land B) \\land C \\leftrightarrow A \\land (B \\land C)\\) When we have three arguments for a binary and consume them in different orders (apply it to 1 and 2 then the result to 3 vs apply it to 2 and 3 first then the result to 1 while keeping the order of the placements) without affecting the final output, then we say the operation is associative. So here $\\land$ is asssociative. | You can distribute $\\land$ over $\\lor$: \\(A \\land (B \\lor C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\land B) \\lor (A \\land C)\\) | You can also distribute $\\lor$ over $\\land$: \\(A \\lor (B \\land C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\lor B) \\land (A \\lor C)\\) | \\[(A \\to (B \\to C)) \\leftrightarrow (A \\land B \\to C)\\] | Transitivity of implication: \\((A \\to B) \\to ((B \\to C) \\to (A \\to C))\\) | \\[((A \\lor B) \\to C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\to C) \\lor (B \\to C)\\] | \\[\\neg (A \\lor B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg A \\land \\neg B\\] | \\(\\neg (A \\land B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg A \\lor \\neg B\\) | \\[\\neg (A \\to B) \\leftrightarrow A \\land \\neg B\\] | \\[\\neg A \\to (A \\to B)\\] | \\((\\neg A \\lor B) \\leftrightarrow (A \\to B)\\) | \\[\\neg(A \\leftrightarrow \\neg A)\\] | \\[(A \\to B) \\leftrightarrow (\\neg B \\to \\neg A)\\] | \\((A \\to (B \\lor C)) \\to ((A \\to B) \\lor (A \\to C))\\) | If $B \\leftrightarrow C$, then for any $A$ we have . | \\[A \\lor B \\leftrightarrow A \\lor C\\] | \\[A \\land B \\leftrightarrow A \\land C\\] | \\[A \\to B \\leftrightarrow A \\to C\\] | . | . Each of the above can provide a useful logical shortcut when in the midst of a mathematical argument. ",
