The corresponding connective in logic has the fancy name of conjunction is denoted by $\\land$. So if we have expressions $C$ and $D$, then $C \\land D$ is another valid expression. Now let‚Äôs think about what we can deduce assuming we know $C$ and $D$. It may seem silly but if we know $C \\land D$ then we know $C$. So we have the following elimination rule for deduction . The notation we use for this move is $\\land_{E_L}$. Similarly, we have the right-sided analog. Then we have a introduction rule that mirrors: if we know that $C$ is true and $D$ is true, then we know that $C$ and $D$ is true. Note that at this level we know very little. For example, $A \\land B \\land C$ is ambigious. It is either \\((A \\land B) \\land C\\) or \\(A \\land (B \\land C)\\) But these are logically equivalent, meaning we can prove one from the other and vice-versa.

Our introduction rules are pretty straightforward. The elimination rule is a bit more subtle. If we want to reach our goal $C$ and we know that $A$ or $B$ is true, then we need to justify $C$ in two separate cases. One case for when $A$ is true and one case for when $B$ is true. This means that elimination needs to take in a proof $A \\vdash C$ and $B \\vdash C$. Note the lines above $A$ and $B$. This an example of hypothetical reasoning. We have assumed that $A$ is true and provided some argument to derive $C$. Similarly, we have assumed that $B$ is true and argued to $C$. Given both, then know that $A \\lor B \\vdash C$.

    "title": "Deduction",
    "content": "The operations we use to combine expressions will reflect oft-occuring structures in human reason. But, we also need to model the common steps in deduction. Here there are two separate roles: assumptions we are given and goals we want to establish (if we can). In the written (or natural) language, you might see. Example. If $n$ and $m$ are even integers, then so is $n-m$. Recall here that the integers are \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\lbrace \\ldots, -2,-1,0,1,2, \\ldots \\rbrace\\) . This could also be written as . Example. Let $n$ and $m$ be even integers. The integer $n-m$ is also an even integer. While the latter example is not written an explicit if-then the content is the same. Our set of assumptions is $n$ and $m$ are even integers while our goal is $n-m$ is an even integer. Let‚Äôs write down a proof of these statements. We can represent as a table. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n, m$ even | $n-m$ is even | . Mathematics is well-known for compact (and difficult) notation. In a proof, it is often valuable to unfold the definitions into the statement they represent. We perform this operation on the assumptions. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m$ is even | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | ¬† | . We also rewrite the goal in the same way. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | ¬† | . To achieve our goal, we want to exhibit the desired $e$ using the assumptions at hand. To make progress, we import another ‚Äúknown fact‚Äù into the assumptions context: distribution of multiplication over subtraction. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | ¬† | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ | ¬† | . Now we can an apply distribution with $u = 2, v = c, w = d$ to gain another statement and finish. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | ¬† | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ | ¬† | . | $n - m = 2c - 2d = 2(c-d)$ | ¬† | . | set $e = c-d$ | ¬† | . | $n -m = 2e$ | ¬† | . While we modeled this proof as a table, it is notationally simpler to represent deduction from assumption $A$ to goal $B$ (with some intermediate steps) vertically. And we write $A \\vdash B$ to indicate that we can prove the goal(s) $B$ given the assumption(s) $A$. ",

    "title": "Symbolic and semantic",
    "content": "Human reason follows some basic patterns. The truth of one statement is often connected to the truth of another statement. For example, let‚Äôs take the following example. Example. If it is cloudy outside, then I don‚Äôt need my sunglasses. To understand the content of this course, the first thing we need to do is disentangle our thought a bit. There are two closely related but distinct facets of this example. There is the truth of the statement. Is it actually cloudy outside or not? Do I actually need sunglasses or not? Whether or not someone actually needs their sunglasses probably depends on the person and the level of cloudiness. In focusing on the truth of a statement, we care about the semantics of the proposition. Distinctly, we can also view this statement as built up from basic ‚Äúatoms‚Äù using well-defined rules. In our semantic analysis, we already have broken it down into two separate statements that can either be truth or false in principal: . $A$. It is cloudy outside . $B$. I don‚Äôt need my sunglasses . Our example statement is built up from $A$ and $B$ via a if-then construction. It then makes sense to denote it by $A \\Rightarrow B$. The fancy arrow $\\Rightarrow$ stands in for the if-then. Thus, symbolically we have $A$ and $B$ and $\\Rightarrow$ provides a way to connect them to make a new formal symbol \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) . Symbolically, $A$ and $B$ have no infused meaning so why do we even consider this? . Because symbolic manipulation can be incredibly powerful. It can streamline human thought. It can be mechanized in a computer program. It can be converted in a game. For mathematicians, logical reasoning is especially important. When reasoning about intricate structures, it is incredibly easy to make a mistake. The history of mathematics is rich with such examples. To help minimize errors, mathematicians grounded their arguments in logical deduction and fostered a culture of rigorous proofs. Let‚Äôs look at a more mathematical example. Recall that \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\lbrace 0,1,2,\\ldots \\rbrace\\) is the set of natural numbers. A natural number $n$ is even if it can be written as $n = 2m$ for some other natural number $m$. A number is odd if is not even. Example. Let $n$ be a natural number. If $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd. t If we denote . $A$. $n$ is even. $B$. $n+1$ is odd. then symbolically we can represent the statement as before \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) But semantically this if very different than our cloudy/sunglasses example above. We start by introducing the basic structure of logical argument. ",

You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors.

I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don‚Äôt mind letting you work independently at all. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation:¬†Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 5 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic.¬†If symptoms persist on the fifth day, then the isolation must be extended to 10 days. What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the¬†Student Ombudsman. ¬†Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the¬†COVID-19 Student Report Form¬†and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.¬† . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",
