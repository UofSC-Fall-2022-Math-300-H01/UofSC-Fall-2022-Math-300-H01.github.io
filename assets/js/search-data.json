    "doc": "Basics",
    "title": "Sets and membership",
    "content": "We want to talk sensibly and precisely about collecitons of mathematical objects. The notion of a set accomplishes this. Like when working with predicate logic, we first fix an universal repoository $\\mathcal U$. Members of $\\mathcal U$ are called elements. Definition. A set $X$ is a (sub)collection of elements from $\\mathcal U$. The basic operation we can perform given an element $x$ and a set $X$ is to ask whether $x$ is in $X$ or not, ie to check membership. We use the notation $x \\in X$ for the predicate: $x$ is an element of $X$. And we use $x \\not \\in X$ for $\\neg (x \\in X)$. Example. Suppose we are talking about all the dogs that live in neighborhood at home. Then our universal set $\\mathcal D$ is a giant list of every dog, perhaps identified by name. We can make new sets in a few ways. For example, \\(\\text{Fritz}, \\text{Herman}, \\text{Sam}\\) would form a set. We use special notation to indicate we are forming a set: curly braces $\\lbrace ~ \\rbrace$. So we would write the previous set of dogs \\(W := \\lbrace \\text{Fritz}, \\text{Herman}, \\text{Sam} \\rbrace\\) to indicate we are talking about a set of dogs. In building the set $W$, we explicitly listed out the members of the set. Depending on the time and page length, this might not be feasible in general. Suppose that all the stars of the Air Bud franchise lived in the neighborhood. Then, without confusion, we can label each lead golden retriever with corresponding movie. If I wanted a set consisting of all the stars of Air Bud. Often, we are bit lazier in writing down a set. For example \\(AB := \\lbrace \\text{Air Bud}, \\text{Air Bud: Golden Retriever}, \\ldots, \\text{Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups} \\rbrace\\) We wrote out the first few elements of the set and the last one and we expect people to infer the rest from context. People would know for instance that \\(\\text{Air Buddy} \\in AB\\) and \\(\\text{Lassie} \\not \\in AB\\) (Admittedly, this works better when talking about more rigid things like numbers. Most people could guess that \\(\\lbrace 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9, 10 \\rbrace\\) is the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10.) . The final common way to make a set is by specifying a condition that must hold as the condition for membership in that set. \\(D := \\lbrace d \\mid d \\text{ is a weiner dog} \\rbrace\\) denotes the set consisting of dogs in our universal set (in the neighborhood) that are dachshunds. So $d \\in D$ if and only if $d$ is a weiner dog. Perhaps $D$ is too large and we are only concerned with weiner dogs owned by my grandmother. \\(GD := \\lbrace d \\in D \\mid d \\text{ is owned by my grandma} \\rbrace\\) So $GD$ consists of the weiner dogs that are also owned by my grandmother. So to check the $d \\in GD$ we would have to verify that both . | $d$ is a weiner dog and | $d$ is my grandmaâs dog | . It turns out that \\(\\text{Fritz} \\in GD \\\\ \\text{Herman} \\in GD \\\\ \\text{Sam} \\in GD\\) and there are no other weiner dogs that my grandmother owns. Both $W$ and $GD$ consist of exactly the same collection of elements so they are equal sets \\(W = GD\\) . The equality is an incarnation of a general principle called set extensionality. Set Extensionality. Two sets $X$ and $Y$ are equal if and only if $X$ and $Y$ have the same elements. We can express this using a logical formula \\(X = Y \\leftrightarrow \\forall z~ (z \\in X \\leftrightarrow z \\in Y)\\) . Extensionality of sets provides the fundamental way of checking two sets are equal. Example. Consider the two sets \\(X = \\{2,3,5,7\\}\\) and \\(Y = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\text{ is prime and } n &lt; 10 \\}\\) . The two sets are in fact equal. To show this, we prove that \\(\\forall n~ (n \\in X \\leftrightarrow n \\in Y)\\) Remember to introduce a universal quantifier, we need to prove $n \\in X \\leftrightarrow n \\in Y$ where $n$ is now free. To introduce a bi-implication, we need two proofs. One of $n \\in X \\to n \\in Y$ and one of $n \\in Y \\to n \\in X$. We first prove that $n \\in X \\to n \\in Y$. To introduce an implication, we assume that $n \\in X$ is true and check that $n \\in Y$. So assume that \\(n \\in X = \\lbrace 2,3,5,7 \\rbrace\\) We want to prove that $n \\in Y$. The claim of membership $n \\in Y$ is equivalent to $n$ satisfying the predicate \\(n \\text{ is prime and } &lt; 10\\) So to show that $n \\in Y$ we check truth of the predicate. We can do this case by case. If $n = 2$, then $n$ is prime because the only natural number that divides it is $1$ and $n &lt; 10$. If $n = 3$, then $n$ is prime and $n &lt; 10$. If $n = 5$, then $n$ is prime and $n &lt; 10$. If $n = 7$, then $n$ is prime and $n &lt; 10$. Thus, if $n \\in X$, then $n \\in Y$. Next we assume that $n \\in Y$ and our goal is to show that $n \\in X$. Assume that $n \\in Y$. This is the same as saying that $n$ is prime and $n &lt; 10$. We know the list of natural numbers less that than $10$ is \\(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\) So far this is larger than $X$; it has $X$ but it also has more elements. We check which of these are prime to see which are elements are actually in $Y$. We go case by case. If $n = 0$, then $0 = 2 \\cdot 0$, so $2 \\mid 0$ and $0$ is not prime. If $n = 4$, then $4 = 2 \\cdot 2$ so $4$ is not prime. If $n=6$, then $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ so $6$ is not prime. $8 = 2 \\cdot 4$ so $8$ is not prime. $9 = 3 \\cdot 3$ so $9$ is not prime. Thus, the only elements that could be in $Y$ are $2,3,5,7$, ie $n \\in Y \\to n \\in X$. Definition. We say $X$ is a subset of $X$ if $\\forall x~ (x \\in X \\to x \\in Y)$. In other words, every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$. We write $X \\subseteq Y$ is $X$ is a subset of $Y$. If $X \\subseteq Y$ and $ X \\not = Y$, then we write $X \\subset Y$. Note that this means we can express extensionality as $X = Y$ if and only if $X \\subseteq Y$ and $Y \\subseteq X$. Recall that $\\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers. These numbers are represented by points on an infinite line and should be familiar from calculus. (This is not a precise definition.) . Example. Consider the sets \\([0,1] := \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\rbrace \\\\ (0,1] := \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 &lt; x \\leq 1 \\rbrace \\\\ \\lbrack 0,1) := \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 \\leq x &lt; 1 \\rbrace \\\\ (0,1) := \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\rbrace\\) . Then \\([0,1] \\supseteq (0,1] \\supseteq (0,1) \\\\ \\lbrack 0,1] \\supseteq [0,1) \\supseteq (0,1) \\\\ (0,1] \\nsubseteq [0,1) \\\\ \\lbrack 0,1) \\nsubseteq (0,1]\\) . ",

    "title": "Basics of functions",
    "content": "As we have seen Lean has built in types function f : A â B. We encountered these when dealing with implication in propositional/predicate logic. Given propositions P Q : Prop, a term h : P â Q is a function that inputs proofs of P and outputs proofs of Q. Similarly, we modeled predicates as functions P : U â Prop which take terms of a general type U and output propositions. And a proof h : â x, P x is function whose inputs are terms x : U and whose output at a given x is a proof of P x. The last incarnation is particularly instructive of the power of the existence of a function. For a general predicate P, there will be not be a proof of â x, P x. In other words, we will not be able to make a well-defined function. The Lean notation and the mathematical notation for a function coincide: f : A â B. Here A is called the domain of f and B is called the codomain of f. In other words, the domain of a function is the type of its inputs and the codomain is the type of outputs. Mathematically, it is useful to approach to construction of a function with more an artistic mentality. Often we will make a function that where the output seemingly depends on more data than the given inputs and then provide a proof that the extra data, while not extraneous, does not change the output when it changes. Checking this is usually called checking that a function is well-defined. Example. Suppose $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a real number. Consider the function \\(x \\mapsto \\sqrt{x}\\) Where $\\sqrt{x}$ satisfies $(\\sqrt{x})^2 = x$. Is this a well-defined function? For any input from $\\mathbb{R}$, we need to be able to evaluate this function into a single output. Problem #1: if $x &lt; 0$, then there are no (real number) solutions to $y^2 = x$. Thus, this proposed function cannot be evaluated for $x &lt; 0$. We would say that this is not well-defined for $x &lt; 0$. Problem #2: Letâs assume that $x \\geq 0$. We now have another problem. If $x &gt; 0$, then there are two choices for $\\sqrt{x}$, a positive one and a negative one. Thus this is also not a well-defined function for $x&gt;0$. To fix this, we impose some additional conditions. First, the domain of $\\sqrt{x}$ is not all of $\\mathbb{R}$. It is all real numbers satisfying $x \\geq 0$. The square root function, as it appeared in your calculus class, is then the positive solution to the equation $y^2 = x$ for a given input $x &gt; 0$ and is, of course, $0$ if $x=0$. In Lean, we cannot write a non-well-defined function - the type checker will yell at us. Suppose you are handed a type U and are asked for some function f : U â U. What can you do? You can hand back the input as the output. Definition. The identity function is the function whose output is equal to input, i.e. $x \\mapsto x$. The identity function depends on the type of x. Letâs see it in Lean. variable (Î± : Type) #check @id Î± -- id : Î± â Î± . With more information about the input type we can generally make more functions. variable (Î± Î² : Type) -- if we take a product term we can project onto each component def proj (z : Î± Ã Î²) := z.1 #check proj Î± Î² -- proj Î± Î² : Î± Ã Î² â Î± . As we can see projection for product types is also built in already using z.1,z.2 or z.fst,z.snd. Letâs get even more specific. Lean knows about natural numbers and all the usual arithmetic operations we can apply to them. The name for $\\mathbb{N}$ in Lean is Nat. def f : Nat â Nat := fun n =&gt; 2*n^3 + 4*n + 3 #eval f 5 -- 273 . The command #eval calls a more efficient (but less type-safe) evaluation program to compute the application of f. ",

    "content": "One of the most powerful aspects of functions is the ability to chain them together, one after another after anotherâ¦ . If we have f : A â B, g: B â C, then we can take an input a, feed it into f as f a, and then feed that into g as g (f a). The result is the composition of f and g. Definition. Given functions $f : A \\to B$ and $g : B \\to C$, the composition of $g$ and $f$ is the function \\(a \\mapsto g(f(a))\\) The composition is denoted as $g \\circ f$ and is typed in Lean as Function.comp and is abbreviated as \\circ. Note that composing is only possible if the codomain of $f$ equals the domain of $g$. Letâs see some examples in Lean. def f : Nat â Nat := fun n =&gt; 2*n^3 + 4*n + 3 def g (n : Nat) : Nat := n^2 + 1 #check g â f -- g â f : Nat â Nat #eval f 1 -- 9 #eval g (f 1) -- 82 #eval (g â f) 1 -- 82 -- note that the order of composition is essential #eval f (g 1) -- 27 . In general $g \\circ f \\neq f \\circ g$ even if both compositions are well-defined so functional composition is non-commutative. It is associative however. Theorem. Composition of functions is an associative operation. In other words, if $f: A \\to B$, $g : B \\to C$, and $h : C \\to D$ are three functions, then \\((h \\circ g) \\circ f = h \\circ (g \\circ f)\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Two functions $f_1,f_2$ are equal if they have the same domains and codomains and if for any element $x$ of the domain we have $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$. More plainly, two functions are equal if - they take in the same types of inputs - they give back the same type of outputs and - for any input, they evaluate to the same output So to prove this we assume we have some $a$ from $A$ and evaluate both sides. The left-hand side is by definition $$ ((h \\circ g) \\circ f)(a) = (h \\circ g)(f(a)) = h(g(f(a))) $$ The right-hand side is $$ (h \\circ (g \\circ f))(a) = h((g \\circ f)(x)) = h(g(f(a))) $$ These are equal so the functions are equal. &#9632; . What does the proof of associativity look like in Lean? . variable (Î± Î² Î³ Î´ : Type) variable (f : Î± â Î²) (g : Î² â Î³) (h : Î³ â Î´) theorem Assoc : (h â g) â f = h â (g â f) := by apply funext -- the goal is now -- â¢ â (x : Î±), Function.comp (h â g) f x = Function.comp h (g â f) x intro a rfl . Here funext is a (more robust) version of the proposition \\(\\forall f_1,f_2 : A \\to B, f_1 = f_2 \\leftrightarrow (\\forall a, f_1(a) = f_2(a))\\) and stands for functional extensionality (similar to set extensionality). Notice also that rfl closed the goal Function.comp (h â g) f x = Function.comp h (g â f) x even though it is not immediately of the form t = t, i.e. something is equal to itself. This is due to the fact that rfl can also reduce terms to their more basic form, just like we did in our own pen-and-paper proof of associativity of functional composition. The identity function plays a special rule in composition - composing with it does nothing. Or stated at more high-level: composition with an identity function is also an identity function but now for functions: $f \\mapsto f$. variable (Î± Î² : Type) variable (f : Î± â Î²) theorem comp_id : f â (@id Î±) = f := by apply funext intro x rfl theorem id_comp : (@id Î²) â f = f := by apply funext intro x rfl . Another useful consequence of functional extensionality is that if $f = g$ then $f(x) = g(x)$ for any $x$. We could extract this result from funext each time we want to use it but that is not very ergonomic. Instead, the result is already built into Lean as congrFun. variable (Î± Î² : Type) variable (fâ fâ : Î± â Î²) example (h : fâ = fâ) (a : Î±) : fâ a = fâ a := by exact congrFun h a . The contrapositive of this statement is useful. variable (Î± Î² : Type) variable (fâ fâ : Î± â Î²) example (h : â a, fâ a â  fâ a) : fâ â  fâ := by intro n have â¨a,hââ© := h have : fâ a = fâ a := congrFun n a exact hâ this .

    "title": "Basics of relations",
    "content": "We already know what relations are. We saw then as part of predicate logic. Definition. A relation is a binary predicate. So in Lean we would write . variable (U : Type) variable (R : U â U â Prop) . In sets, one usually defines a relation on elements of a set $X$ as a subset \\(R \\subseteq X \\times X\\) The corresponding predicate is then \\((x,x^\\prime) \\in R\\) . We write $x R y$ to abbreviate that staement that $x$ is related by $R$ to $y$, the predicate is satisfied for the values $x$ and $y$. Often from the context, we will just write $x \\sim y$. The simple definition allows for a variety of examples. Examples . | We could simply take | . def R (x y : U) := fun x y =&gt; False . Since there is no proof of false, no pairs are even related. The corresponding subset of $U \\times U$ is $\\varnothing$. | At the other end of the extreme, we have | . def R (x y : U) := fun x y =&gt; True . Here every pair $(x,y)$ is related. The corresponding subset of $U \\times U$ is $U \\times U$ itself. | Equality is perhaps the most familiar example of a relation. | . def R (x y : U) := fun x y =&gt; x = y . The corresponding subset of $U \\times U$ is called the diagonal \\(\\Delta_U := \\lbrace (x,x) \\in U \\times U \\mid x \\in U \\rbrace\\) . | Lets take the natural numbers. Thanks to their rich structure there are many possible relations. We have the familiar relation based on size of integers: $n &lt; m$ denotes that $n$ is less than $m$. Lean already knows about this | . variable (n m : Nat) #check n &lt; m -- n &lt; m : Prop . The subset of the $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is just \\(R_{&lt;,\\mathbb{N}} := \\lbrace (n,m) \\mid n &lt; m \\rbrace\\) If we identity $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ with the lattice points in the first quadrant of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then we can visualize $R_{&lt;,\\mathbb{N}$ as all the points above the line $y = x$. | We have the close cousin of $ &lt; $ on $\\mathbb{N}$ : $\\leq$, less than or equal. We simply combined two relations we have seen above using an $\\lor$ \\(n \\leq m \\leftrightarrow (n &lt; m) \\lor (n=m)\\) Since have combined two relations using an or statement we get the union of their corresponding subsets \\(R_{\\leq, \\mathbb{N}} = \\Delta_{\\mathbb{N}} \\cup R_{&lt;,\\mathbb{N}}\\) | The previous example built a new relation from an old one using a particular logical connective. One can, of course, use the other connectives, $\\to, \\land, \\neg$. For example, we have \\(x &gt; y := \\neg (x \\leq y)\\) where the corresponding subset is $R_{\\leq, \\mathbb{N}}^c$, the complement. | We can also use arithmetic to build relations on natural numbers. For example, we have divisibility $a \\mid b$ if there exists some $c$ with $b = ac$. | Similarly, we can use functions to build new relations from old ones. For example, letâs take $ &lt; $ on the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ and the absolute value function $| \\cdot | : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Letâs say that $x$ is related to $y$ if $|x| \\leq |y|$. This gives a new relation which is equal to $x \\in [-y,y]$. | . Looking at our examples, we say a variety of behaviors. For some, we have $x \\sim x$ for all $x$, like $=$, but for others we donât, like $&lt;$. For some we can always compare $x$ to $y$ or vice-versa; for others we canât. There are a handful of natural properties we can impose on relations which we will discuss next. ",

Now letâs think about what we can deduce assuming we know $C$ and $D$. It may seem silly but if we know $C \\land D$ then we know $C$. So we have the following elimination rule for deduction . The notation we use for this move is $\\land_{E_L}$. Similarly, we have the right-sided analog. Then we have a introduction rule that mirrors: if we know that $C$ is true and $D$ is true, then we know that $C$ and $D$ is true. Note that at this level we know very little. For example, $A \\land B \\land C$ is ambigious. It is either \\((A \\land B) \\land C\\) or \\(A \\land (B \\land C)\\) But these are logically equivalent, meaning we can prove one from the other and vice-versa.

Thus, we can reduce to proving $$ (A \\to B) \\land (B \\to C), A \\vdash C $$ With $A$ and $A \\to B$, we can eliminate to $B$. Then with $B$ and $B \\to C$, we can eliminate to $C$.

So it suffices to show $$ ((A \\lor B) \\to C) \\vdash ((A \\to C) \\land (B \\to C)) $$ Now to establish a goal with $\\land$ we want to prove both sides of the $\\land$.

Here there are two separate roles: assumptions we are given and goals we want to establish (if we can). In the written (or natural) language, you might see. Example. If $n$ and $m$ are even integers, then so is $n-m$. Recall here that the integers are \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\lbrace \\ldots, -2,-1,0,1,2, \\ldots \\rbrace\\) . This could also be written as . Example. Let $n$ and $m$ be even integers. The integer $n-m$ is also an even integer. While the latter example is not written an explicit if-then the content is the same. Our set of assumptions is $n$ and $m$ are even integers while our goal is $n-m$ is an even integer. Letâs write down a proof of these statements. We can represent as a table. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n, m$ even | $n-m$ is even | . Mathematics is well-known for compact (and difficult) notation. In a proof, it is often valuable to unfold the definitions into the statement they represent. We perform this operation on the assumptions. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m$ is even | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | Â  | . We also rewrite the goal in the same way. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | Â  | . To achieve our goal, we want to exhibit the desired $e$ using the assumptions at hand. To make progress, we import another âknown factâ into the assumptions context: distribution of multiplication over subtraction. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | Â  | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ | Â  | . Now we can an apply distribution with $u = 2, v = c, w = d$ to gain another statement and finish. | Assumptions | Goal | . | $n = 2c$ for some integer $c$ | $n-m = 2e$ for some integer $e$ | . | $m = 2d$ for some integer $d$ | Â  | . | $u(v-w) = uv-uw$ for all integers $u,v,w$ | Â  | . | $n - m = 2c - 2d = 2(c-d)$ | Â  | . | set $e = c-d$ | Â  | . | $n -m = 2e$ | Â  | . While we modeled this proof as a table, it is notationally simpler to represent deduction from assumption $A$ to goal $B$ (with some intermediate steps) vertically. And we write $A \\vdash B$ to indicate that we can prove the goal(s) $B$ given the assumption(s) $A$. ",

Then, in natural language, the head of the implication says that for any number $y$ there is some other number $x$ such that $x=y$. This of course is always true!

Similarly, $\\neg \\forall x~ A(x) \\leftrightarrow \\exists x~ \\neg A(x)$ is a valid formula. In fact, we have already been using this logical pattern in our arguments. It is usually called finding a counter-example. The counter-example being the witness to $\\exists x~ \\neg A(x)$. ",

For example, in the model $\\mathbb{N}$ where we interpret $A(x)$ as $x$ is even and $B(x)$ as $x$ is odd. Then, we know that everyone number is either even or odd. But not every number is even. Neither is every number odd. There is a still an implication. Similarly, one direction of distrubition of $\\exists$ over $\\land$ is valid.

If you know a little set theory, it will be harmless to imagine replacing the semi-colon with an element symbol $\\in$. Lean has type for propositions called Prop.

    "content": "If we already know about sets, then we can actually construct functions directly. At first the definition looks a little strange. Definition. Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A function $f : X \\to Y$ is a subset \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq X \\times Y\\) satisfying the condition \\(\\forall~ x, \\exists !~ (x',y) \\in \\Gamma, x = x'\\) In other words, in our subset of pairs, $\\Gamma$, given an element $x \\in X$, there is one and exactly one ordered pair of the form $(x,y)$. Given a function, $\\Gamma_f$, we can define application of the function to an element $x \\in X$ as \\(x \\mapsto y\\) where $y$ is the unique element of $Y$ making $(x,y) \\in \\Gamma_f$ hold. Given a function of the familiar type $f : X \\to Y$, we can make subset of $X \\times Y$ as \\(\\Gamma_f := \\lbrace (x,f(x)) \\mid x \\in X \\rbrace\\) This is commonly called the graph of $f$. Given a $f : A \\to B$ and a subset $X \\subseteq A$, we define a new subset of $B$. Definition. The image of $X$ under the function $f$ is the set \\(f(X) := \\lbrace b \\mid \\exists~ x \\in X, f x = b \\rbrace\\) . Example. If \\(f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\\\ n \\mapsto n^2\\) is our function, then $f(\\mathbb{N})$ is the set of natural numbers which are squares. If we instead start with a subset $Y \\subseteq B$, then we can create a subset of $A$. Definition. The pre-image (or inverse image) of $Y$ is the set \\(f^{-1}(Y) := \\{ a \\mid f(a) \\in Y \\}\\) . Coming back to our example of the squaring map, we would have \\(f^{-1}(\\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \\rbrace) = \\{0,1,2\\}\\) . Lemma. $f$ is surjective if and only if $f(X) = Y$. Proof. (Expand to view) Assume that $f$ is surjective. From the definition, we know that $f(X) \\subseteq Y$. For the other direction, assume we have $y \\in Y$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists a $x \\in X$ with $f(x) = y$. But, by definition of the image $X$ under $f$, this says $y \\in f(X)$. Assume that $f(X) = Y$. To show that $f$ is surjective, we choose some $y \\in Y$ and look for an $x$ with $f(x) = y$. But, by definition of the image, we know there is such an $x$. &#9632; . More generally, we get two statements describing what happens when we take images of pre-images and pre-images of images. Lemma. For any $Y$, we have \\(f(f^{-1} Y) \\subseteq Y\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Let $b \\in f(f^{-1} Y)$. We unfold the definitions to check this. Since $b \\in f(f^{-1} Y)$, we have, by definition, there exists some $a \\in f^{-1} Y$ such that $f(a) = b$. Since $a \\in f^{-1} Y$, by definition, we have $f(a) \\in Y$. Thus, $b = f(a) \\in Y$. &#9632; . Note that this is not an equality in general. If we have an equality, then every element of $Y$ is in the image of $f$ applied to $f^{-1} Y$. In particular, it forces $f$ to surject onto $Y$. Lemma. For any $X$, we have \\(X \\subseteq f^{-1}(f(X))\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Again, this comes from chaining together the definitions. Assume that $a \\in X$. Then $f(a) \\in f(X)$. Thus, by definition, $a \\in f^{-1} (f(X))$. &#9632; . Again this is not always an equality. For example, lets taking our squaring map but now view it a function $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. If $X = \\mathbb{N}$, then $f^{-1}(f(\\mathbb{N})) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Both images and pre-images behave well with respect to unions and intersections.

    "title": "Being in bijection",
    "content": "Saying that we have a bijection $f : A \\to B$ is quite strong. For each element of $a$ there is exactly one element of $b$ and vice-versa. You go back and forth by apply $f$ or its inverse. While particular bijections can be highly non-trivial, we can still abstract them as a âchange of labelsâ for a set. Example. Let $R_m$ be the complex roots of the polynomial $z^m - 1$. The roots are of the form $e^{2 \\pi \\imath j/m}$ for $j = 0,\\ldots,m-1$. Thus, there is a bijection between the set of $R_m$ and the set $[m] := \\lbrace 0, 1, \\ldots, m-1 \\rbrace$. One of this is very simple, $[m]$, while the other carries interesting algebraic information. Definition. We say $A$ and B$ are in bijection if there exists a bijection $f : A \\to B$. We write $A \\cong B$ if $A$ and $B$ are in bijection. Even if $A \\cong B$, there is, in general, not a single bijection nor a canonical choice for one. Letâs look at self-bijections $\\sigma : [m] \\to [m]$. In general, if we have an injective function $f : [m] \\to A$, then we have at least $m$ distinct (up to equality) elements of $A$. Now, if $A = [m]$, then we only have $[m]$ distinct elements to being with. Thus, $\\sigma : [m] \\to [m]$ is bijective if and only if it is injective. Similarly, if $\\sigma : [m] \\to [m]$ is surjective, then we have to have $m$ elements in $\\sigma([m])$. But, for any function with domain $[m]$, the image can have at most $m$ elements since we only have $m$ elements to plug in to $f$. If we have exactly $m$ elements, then $\\sigma$ must be injective. Each time $\\sigma(i) = \\sigma(j)$, with $i \\neq j$, we drop the size of the image of by 1. Thus, $\\sigma$ is bijective if and only if it is surjective. We have established the following result. Theorem. (Pigeonhole Principle) A function $f : X \\to Y$ with $X, Y$ finite and of the same order is a bijection if and only if it is an injection if and only if it is a surjection. Similar logic gives the . Corollary. If $f : X \\to Y$ is a function between finite sets and $|X| &lt; |Y|$, then $f$ is not surjective. If $|X| &gt; |Y|$, then $f$ is not injective. The previous results tell us to recognize bijections between finite sets. We see that for $\\sigma : [m] \\to [m]$ to be a bijection. We have some value $\\sigma(0)$. Then there is some value $\\sigma(1) \\neq \\sigma(0)$. Then $\\sigma(2) \\neq \\sigma(1)$ and $\\neq \\sigma(0)$ . Finally, leaving a unique choice for $\\sigma(m)$. So a self-bijection of $[m]$ is scrambling of the order of the numbers $0,1,2,\\ldots, m-1$. There are $m$ choices for the value of $0$, $m-1$ choices for $1$,., $2$ choices for $m-2$, and a single choice for $m-1$. Thus, we have \\(m! := m(m-1)(m-2) \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1\\) unique self-bijections of $[m]$. Such self-bijections are called permutations. Example. Letâs write down all the permutations of the set $[3]$. We as (possibly) disordered lists: \\(123, 132, 213, 312, 231, 321\\) The first entry of the list is the identity function. ",

If it is cloudy outside, then I donât need my sunglasses. To understand the content of this course, the first thing we need to do is disentangle our thought a bit. There are two closely related but distinct facets of this example. There is the truth of the statement. Is it actually cloudy outside or not? Do I actually need sunglasses or not? Whether or not someone actually needs their sunglasses probably depends on the person and the level of cloudiness. In focusing on the truth of a statement, we care about the semantics of the proposition. Distinctly, we can also view this statement as built up from basic âatomsâ using well-defined rules. In our semantic analysis, we already have broken it down into two separate statements that can either be truth or false in principal: . $A$. It is cloudy outside . $B$. I donât need my sunglasses . Our example statement is built up from $A$ and $B$ via a if-then construction. It then makes sense to denote it by $A \\Rightarrow B$. The fancy arrow $\\Rightarrow$ stands in for the if-then. Thus, symbolically we have $A$ and $B$ and $\\Rightarrow$ provides a way to connect them to make a new formal symbol \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) . Symbolically, $A$ and $B$ have no infused meaning so why do we even consider this? . Because symbolic manipulation can be incredibly powerful. It can streamline human thought. It can be mechanized in a computer program. It can be converted in a game. For mathematicians, logical reasoning is especially important. When reasoning about intricate structures, it is incredibly easy to make a mistake. The history of mathematics is rich with such examples. To help minimize errors, mathematicians grounded their arguments in logical deduction and fostered a culture of rigorous proofs. Letâs look at a more mathematical example. Recall that \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\lbrace 0,1,2,\\ldots \\rbrace\\) is the set of natural numbers. A natural number $n$ is even if it can be written as $n = 2m$ for some other natural number $m$. A number is odd if is not even. Example. Let $n$ be a natural number. If $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd. t If we denote . $A$. $n$ is even. $B$. $n+1$ is odd. then symbolically we can represent the statement as before \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) But semantically this if very different than our cloudy/sunglasses example above.

    "content": "A natural question to ask about a process is whether it can be undone. We can ask the same about a function. Definition. A left inverse to a function $f: A \\to B$ is a function $g : B \\to A$ such that $g \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_A$. Here $\\operatorname{id}_A$ is the identity function on $A$ so this can rewritten as $g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a$. To define a left inverse in Lean, we confront an new problem: we really need to pieces of mathematical data: for the function $g : B \\to A$ and then the proof that $g \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}$. We can bundle those two things together into a single structure. structure LeftInverse (f : Î± â Î²) where to_fun : Î² â Î± invl : to_fun â f = id def TheFun (g : LeftInverse f) : Î² â Î± := g.to_fun example : g.to_fun â f = id := g.invl . Given a (g : LeftInverse f), we can access the function Î² â Î± as g.to_fun and the proof that g.to_fun â f = id using g.invl. To construct a LeftInverse, we need to supply both pieces of data . def IdInv : LeftInverse (@id Î±) := â¨id,by rflâ© . It also helpful to define single proposition which is true if $f$ has a left inverse. def HasLeftInv (f : Î± â Î²) : Prop := Nonempty (LeftInverse f) . Here Nonempty Î± is proposition that states there is actually some term of type Î±. Definition. A right inverse to $f$ is a function $h : B \\to A$ such that $f \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_B$. Of course, if $h$ is a right inverse for $f$, then $f$ is also a left inverse for $h$. Definition. An inverse to $f$ is a function that is simultaneously a left and right inverse to $f$. Possession of inverses and injectivity/surjective are tied closely together. Theorem. If $f$ has a left inverse, then $f$ is injective. Proof. (Expand to view) Assume we have $a_1,a_2$ with $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ and let $g$ be a left-inverse of $f$. Then, we can apply $g$ to both sides of the equality $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ to get $$ a_1 = g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2)) = a_2 $$ and see that $f$ is injective. &#9632; . Here is a proof in Lean. theorem has_left_inv_injective (f : Î± â Î²) (h : HasLeftInv f) : Injective f := by -- Introduce a pair of arguments and the assumption that -- f evaluates to the same on them intro (aâ:Î±) (aâ:Î±) (lâ: f aâ = f aâ) -- Break up the existence of a left-inverse into a function and a proof it is a -- left inverse have â¨g,lââ© := h -- A calculation block allows us to more efficiently perform equality manipulations calc aâ = id aâ := by rfl -- these reduce to an equality _ = (g â f) aâ := Eq.symm (congrFun lâ aâ) -- we apply equal functions _ = (g â f) aâ := congrArg g lâ -- we apply a function to equal arguments _ = id aâ := congrFun lâ aâ -- we apply equal functions to same value again _ = aâ := by rfl -- done . Similarly, if we have right inverse, then we are surjective. As a corollary, we get the following statement. Corollary. If $f$ has both a right and left inverse, then $f$ is a bijection. In fact if $f$ has both a left and right inverse, then they have to be equal. theorem left_inv_right_inv_eq { f : Î± â Î² } (g : LeftInverse f) (h : RightInverse f) : g.to_fun = h.to_fun := by apply funext intro (b: Î²) calc g.to_fun b = g.to_fun (f (h.to_fun b)) := congrArg g.to_fun (Eq.symm (congrFun h.invr b)) _ = h.to_fun b := congrFun g.invl (h.to_fun b) theorem inv_unique (f : Î± â Î²) (g : Inverse f) (h : Inverse f) : g.to_fun = h.to_fun := by calc g.to_fun = (InvtoLeftInv g).to_fun := by rfl _ = (InvtoRightInv h).to_fun := left_inv_right_inv_eq (InvtoLeftInv g) (InvtoRightInv h) _ = h.to_fun := by rfl .

Suppose $f: A \\to B$ is injective and $A$ is nonempty. Then $f$ has a left inverse. Proof. (Expand to view) We first make our candidate left inverse function $g: B \\to A$. Pick some $b$ from $B$. The idea is to split the definition of $g(b)$ into two cases depending on whether there exists some $a$ with $f(a) = b$ or not. To do so, we know that $A$ is nonempty so we can pick some junk value $a_0$ for use. Then, we \"define\" $g$ as $$ g(b) = \\begin{cases} a &amp;\\text{where $a$ is \\textit{some} value satisfying $f(a) = b$} \\\\ a_0 &amp;\\text{if there is no such solution to $f(a) = b$} \\end{cases} $$ Nothing so far depended on the assumption that $f$ is injective. But we haven't checked that $g$ is, in fact, a left inverse. From the definition, we know that $g(f(a)) = a'$ where $a'$ is some value satisfying $f(a') = f(a)$. Since $f$ is injective, we can conclude that $a = a'$ and that we indeed have a left inverse. &#9632; . So why the quotes around âdefineâ there. It seems reasonable to assume we can pick a value from a nonempty set for each value $b$ where there is one. But this is not a consequence in set theory and requires additional axiom: the Axiom of Choice. Letâs see what this looks like in Lean where we see the use of choice. -- this definition constructs the g in the proof above.

    "title": "Predicate logic in Lean",
    "content": "Like with propositional logic, Lean has the rules of predicate logic embedded within it. As we discussed, predicates are analogous to functions which output propositions. We can declare predicates in Lean as â . variable (Î± : Type) variable (A : Î± â Prop) variable (B : Î± â Î± â Prop) . A new subtlety is variable (Î± : Type). In predicate logic, we have domain of discourse, which is the source of values for the input variables of our predicates. In Lean, we have to declare that we have some source of inputs of our predicates. This notation tells Lean that we have something Î± whose type is the generic Type. Then A is a predicate on a single variable and B is one on two variables. We can understand $\\forall x~ A(x)$ as saying that no matter what the value of $x$ is we have a proof of $A(x)$. In this way, we can think of a proof of $\\forall x~ A(x)$ as a function whose inputs are $x$âs and whose outputs are proofs of $A(x)$. In Lean, this is how â is understood. For example, if we look at . variable (P Q : Prop) theorem not_true : P \\to Q := sorry #check not_true . we will see . not_true : â (P Q : Prop), P â Q . Given any pair of propositions P and Q, the âtheoremâ not_true produces a (sorried) proof of P â Q. Lean represents this using a â. Since â is implemented via as a function, the introduction and elimination rules are familiar. variable (Î± : Type) variable (A : Î± â Prop) example : â (x:Î±), A x â A x := fun x (h : A x) =&gt; h example (y : Î±) (h : â x, A x) : A y := h y . Next, letâs look at the existential quantifier â. variable (Î± : Type) #check @Exists Î± -- @Exists Î± : (Î± â Prop) â Prop #check @Exists.intro Î± -- @Exists.intro Î± : â {p : Î± â Prop} (w : Î±), p w â Exists p #check @Exists.elim Î± -- @Exists.elim Î± : â {p : Î± â Prop} {b : Prop}, -- (â x, p x) â (â (a : Î±), p a â b) â b . Given a domain of discourse Î± and a predicate A : Î± â Prop, the existential quantification â x, A x is a proposition. This is what Exists models. Then, we have our introduction and elimination rules for â built in to Exists. Existential introduction takes . | a domain of discourse Î± (which Lean tries to infer from the context), | a predicate p : Î± â Prop (inferred if possible), | and a value (w : Î±) | . and yields a function that converts proofs of the proposition to p w to an existentially quantified proposition. Elimination will take . | a domain of discourse Î± (inferred), | a predicate p (inferred), | a proposition b, | a proof of â x, p x, | a proof of â (a : Î±), p a â b (ie a function with inputs a and a proof of p a and output a proof of b), | . and will return a proof of b. If we have some value where p is true and for any value p x implies b, then we can conclude b. Here are simple example uses. variable (Î± : Type) variable (A : Î± â Prop) example (x:Î±) (h:P x) : â y, P y := Exists.intro x h example (h : â y, Â¬ P y) : Â¬ (â x, P x) := by intro (g : â x, P x) apply Exists.elim h intro (a : Î±) intro (l : Â¬ P a) exact l (g a) . Next, we have equality, $=$. variable (Î± : Type) #check @Eq Î± -- @Eq : Î± â Î± â Prop . Equality at its most basic level is a special named predicate on two variables. But, we remember it satisfies some properties. Firstly, reflexivity, symmetry, and transistivity. These becomes ways to build equality. variable (Î± : Type) #check @Eq.refl Î± -- @Eq.refl Î± : â (a : Î±), a = a #check @Eq.symm Î± -- @Eq.symm Î± : â {a b : Î±}, a = b â b = a #check @Eq.trans Î± -- @Eq.trans Î± : â {a b c : Î±}, a = b â b = c â a = c . There are also substitution rules for equality, one involving function application and one for predicates. variable (Î± Î² : Type) #check @Eq.subst Î± -- @Eq.subst Î± : â {motive : Î± â Prop} {a b : Î±}, a = b â motive a â motive b example (P : Î± â Prop) (x y : Î±) (e : x = y) (h : P x) : P y := Eq.subst g h #check @congrArg -- @congrArg Î± Î² : â {aâ aâ : Î±} (f : Î± â Î²), aâ = aâ â f aâ = f aâ example (f : Î± â Î±) (x y : Î±) (h : x = y) : f x = f y := congrArg f h .

    "content": "Letâs do some examples of predicate logic proofs in Lean to get comfortable with the new syntax and also introduce a few more useful tactics. First, we prove that â (x : Î±), P x â â (y : Î±), P y. example (Î± : Type) : â (x : Î±), P x â â (y : Î±), P y := by intro (a : Î±) intro (h : P a) exact â¨a, hâ© . From out previous discussion, we would expect the final line to be exact Exists.intro a h. Lean has a shorthard notation for intro rules. We can use French quotes (typed &lt; &gt;) to construct the term. Similarly, if we wanted an And.intro a b, we could â¨a, bâ©. Like most notation it makes thing easier to write but can also make it harder to read. Letâs look at the proof showing we can exchange quantifiers in one direction. variable (Î± : Type) variable (C : Î± â Î± â Prop) example : Type) : (â (x:Î±), â (y:Î±), C x y) â â (v:Î±), â (u:Î±), C u v := by intro h v -- introduce h : â x, â (y : Î±), C x y and v : Î± apply Exists.elim h -- we supply the existential statement and Lean now asks for a proof of -- â¢ â (a : Î±), (â (y : Î±), C a y) â â u, C u v intro g f -- we introduce f : â (y : Î±), C g y and g : Î± apply Exists.intro -- we have new goals â¢ C ?w v and â¢ Î± exact f v -- this solves the first and Lean then infers the second . Note that we can introduce multiple terms just by including a spaced list of labels for them. Next, if there does not exist a value making the predicate true, we can conclude it is false for all values. variable (Î± : Type) variable (P : Î± â Prop) example : (Â¬ â y, P y) â â x, Â¬ P x := by intro h a n exact h â¨a,nâ© . Below we have another example of giving proofs using quantifiers. variable (Î± : Type) variable (P Q : Î± â Prop) example : (â x, P x â Â¬ Q x) â Â¬ â y, P y â§ Q y := by intro h n apply Exists.elim n intro a g -- Here g : P x â§ Q x exact h a g.left g.right -- Lean lets us use the shorthand g.left for And.left g and similarly -- g.right for And.right g . Letâs do a basic example using functions and equality. variable (Î± : Type) variable (P : Î± â Prop) example (f : Î± â Î±) (x y : Î±) (hâ : x = y) (hâ : P (f x)) : P (f y) := by rw [âhâ] -- the goal is now P (f x) assumption . There a few things to notice in this proof. First, we have rw [âhâ] with the backwards â. Leanâs convention for rewriting using x=y is to search for occurrences of x and replace them with y. If we tried rw [hâ], then Lean would return an error . tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression . Lean allows you to rewrite hypotheses in addition to goals but you need to specify the assumption to target. The following proof is also valid. example (f : Î± â Î±) (x y : Î±) (hâ : x = y) (hâ : P (f x)) : P (f y) := by rw [hâ] at hâ -- now hâ is P (f y) assumption . This tells Lean to look for xâs in hâ and replace them with yâs. In both cases, the assumption tactic tells Lean: one of the goals is an established fact in the context, figure out which and close the goal. You can also feed Lean multiple terms to use for rewriting as a list. variable (Î± : Type) variable (x y z : Î±) variable (P : Î± â Prop) example (hâ : x = y) (hâ : z = x) (f : Î± â Î±) : f y = f z := by rw [â hâ, hâ] .

While Lean can infer the type of h from the goal, it is good practice to provide the type yourself. When you disagree with Lean, then its good chance to check your understanding. Next we want to make proofs of A â B and A â C. Previously, we would jam that into an And.intro making the resulting expression dense. The tactic have allows us to introduce new assumptions into the context if we provide proofs. example (A B C : Prop) : (A â B â§ C) â (A â B) â§ (A â C) := by intro (h : A â B â§ C) have (f : A â B) := fun (a:A) =&gt; And.left (h a) have (g : A â C) := fun (a:A) =&gt; And.right (h a) . and the infoview provides the current state . A B C: Prop h : A â B â§ C f: A â B g: A â C â¢ (A â B) â§ (A â C) . Now just need to combine f and g with And.intro. Since And.intro f g is exactly our goal. We use the exact tactic to tell Lean. example (A B C : Prop) : (A â B â§ C) â (A â B) â§ (A â C) := by intro (h : A â B â§ C) have (f : A â B) := fun (a:A) =&gt; And.left (h a) have (g : A â C) := fun (a:A) =&gt; And.right (h a) exact And.intro f g . The infoview celebrates with us: Goals accomplished ð. Another useful tactic is called apply. It applies a function to the goal to get a new goal. For example, . example (a : A) (b : B) : A â§ B := by apply And.intro . gives . case left a: A b: B â¢ A case right a: A b: B â¢ B . in the infoview. We can tackle each case. example (a : A) (b : B) : A â§ B := by apply And.intro case left =&gt; exact a case right =&gt; exact b . To simplify proofs with or elimination, Lean has the tactic cases. example (h : A â¨ B) : B â¨ A := by cases h with | inl a =&gt; exact Or.inr a | inr b =&gt; exact Or.inl b . Each line labelled with | is a case of or elimination. inl tells Lean you are taking the left branch of the or while inr is the right. ",

    "content": "Before we dive into proving statements in predicate logic, we equip ourselves with a useful tool to decide if a formula is not provable. For propositional logic, we used truth assignments and truth tables as a quick tool to establish the lack of a proof. This was only possible because we established soundness of truth assignments: if we could establish $X \\vdash Y$, then we know that $X \\models Y$, ie every truth assignment that makes $X$ true will also make $Y$ true. Propositions are simpler than predicates though. For predicate logic, the interpretations have more moving parts. Our domain of discourse, or source for inputs of the variables, needs to be assigned a concrete set of values. For example, we could consider $\\mathbb{N}$ as our concrete set. Then, each function $f(x)$ should get assigned to a function whose inputs are from $\\mathbb{N}$ and whose outputs lie in $\\mathbb{N}$, like $f(x) = x+1$. Each predicate $A(x)$ may be true for some numbers $x$ and false for others. Thus, we need to assign a set of values for which $A(x)$ is true and assign false for the others. For example, we could assign $A(x)$ to the set of even natural numbers. Meaning, $A(x)$ is true for $x$ even and false $x$ odd. Remember that predicate logic is purely about symbolic manipulation respecting a set of rules. Through models, we imbue some meaning and familiarity to the symbols. Our rules for propogating truth and falsity through our familiar connectives $\\to, \\land, \\lor, \\neg, \\leftrightarrow$. We need ways to assign values to $\\forall$ and $\\exists$. These are built into the motivations for these symbols. We declare that $\\forall x~ A(x)$ evaluates to true if $A(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ in our model. It is false otherwise. For example, we if use $\\mathbb{N}$ and interpret $A(x)$ to be $x &gt; 5$. Then, $\\forall x~ A(x)$ would evaluate to false. But if we interpret $A(x)$ to be $x^2-x \\geq 0$ then we would get true. Similarly, $\\exists x~ A(x)$ evaluates to true if there at least one value in our model making $A(x)$ true and is otherwise false. ",

    "content": "Previously we have been performing purely symbolic moves to generate our proofs. How does this relate to a given mathematics proof or debate topic? . To motivate our rules we have often replaced our symbols $A,B,C,$â¦ by actual statements, eg âthe sun is outâ. âThe sun is outâ can either be true or false â we just look outside. So at a very basic level this provides a way to assign either T or F to a propositional variable. We could of course willy-nilly assign T and F for each our propositional variables. But all of our connectives have familiar interpretation in the context of T/F values. | Not true better be false and vice-versa. So \\(\\neg T \\mapsto F \\ , \\ \\neg F \\mapsto T.\\) We can put this into a table: | . | $A$ | $\\neg A$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | . This expresses the values of $\\neg A$ given the values of $A$. | Suppose I know that $A \\to B$ and we know that is $A$ is $T$. It would make a lot sense to conclude that $B$ should also be assigned $T$. But if we allow ourselves to look at possible assignments it makes sense to assign T/F values to each expression using T/F and $\\to$. We can make another table where we list the values assigned to $A$ along the first column and the values assigned to $B$ in the first row. | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\to B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | . One can read this as saying the implication is itself is true if either assumption is false or both the assumption and conclusion are true. | We also have a table for $\\land$ | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\land B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . which says that $A \\land B$ should only be true if both $A$ and $B$ are. | And we have a table for $\\lor$ | . | $A$ | $B$ | $A \\lor B$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . which says $A \\lor B$ is false only when both $A$ and $B$ are. | We also want \\(\\top \\mapsto T \\\\ \\bot \\mapsto F\\) | . Using these rules, once we have a chosse of T/F, we can assign T/F to any propositional formula. Letâs look at a more complicated formula. Example. Letâs take the formula \\(\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D\\) and the truth assignment \\(A, C \\mapsto T, \\ B, D \\mapsto F\\) . It convenient notation to âplug inâ to the formula the values of $T$ and $F$. This gives \\(\\neg T \\lor F \\to T \\land \\neg F\\) Then use our rules above to simplify down to a single value. First the negation \\(F \\lor F \\to T \\land T\\) Then the $\\lor$ and $\\land$ \\(F \\to T\\) Finally for $\\to$ we reduce to $T$. Different assignments for $A,B,C,D$ can yield a different value for our formula. For example, if \\(B, C, D \\mapsto T, \\ A \\mapsto F\\) Then \\(\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D \\mapsto F\\) . We can think of the possible truth value assignments to our collection of propositional variables as different possible universes. For example, if $A$ is standing for âthe sun is outâ, then $A \\mapsto T$ is saying we know the sun it out while $A \\mapsto F$ is saying the sun is not out. So any real-world or mathematical possibility can be found by listing out all the possible T/F assignments and the values taken by the formula given that assignment. Below is a table for our example . The truth table for our example. (Expand to view) | $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $D$ | $\\neg A \\lor B \\to C \\land \\neg D$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $T$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | .

    "content": "Weâve seen an example where the goal is to give a proof of an equality of sets. Both in Lean and with pen-and-paper, to show two sets are equal X=Y we use set extensionality to reduce to establishing â x, x â X â x â Y. We then take some x â U, prove one direction x â X â x â Y, and then the other x â Y â x â X. While for pen-and-paper everyone can just do this conversion âin their headâ, in Lean we need to step the computer through each time. This can be tedious so we automate it. For that, we can use a tactic called set_extensionality. variable (U : Type) variable (X Y : Set U) example : X = Y := set_extensionality x -- we now have x:U -- and two goals x â X â x â Y and x â X â x â Y -- we sorry these goals because we cannot prove two sets are -- equal in general . sorry . sorry . set_extensionality helps us when proving a goal of the form X=Y. What if we have a hypothesis of set equality? . variable (x:U) variable (X Y Z : Set U) example (h: X = Y) : X âª Z = Y âª Z := by rewrite [h] rfl . Rewriting the goal with the assumption X=Y produces a new goal X âª Z = X âª Z. Recall the tactic rfl solves goals of the form t = t. We can also use rw in place of rewrite and rfl as rw does a rewrite and then calls rfl. Letâs see another one. variable (U : Type) variable (X Y : Set U) example (h : X â Y) : Z \\ Y â Z \\ X := by intro (x:U) (g : x â Z \\ Y) have : x â X := sorry exact â¨g.left,thisâ© . The only thing left is to fill in the sorry. Knowing that if X â Y and x â Y, then x â X seems like a useful result itself. We give it a name and then use it. (Remember that given h : A â§ B we can access a proof of A using h.left and a proof of B using h.right.) . variable (U : Type) variable (X Y : Set U) theorem sub_comp_super (h : X â Y) : Yá¶ â Xá¶ := by intro (x : U) (g : x â Yá¶) (n : l â X) exact g (h x l) example (h : X â Y) : Z \\ Y â Z \\ X := by intro (x:U) (g : x â Z \\ Y) have : x â X := sub_comp_super h x g.right exact â¨g.left,thisâ© . Next we look at the distributivity of intersection over unions. variable (U : Type) variable (X Y Z : Set U) theorem dist_inter_union : X â© (Y âª Z) = (X â© Y) âª (X â© Z) := by set_extensionality x Â· intro (h : x â X â© (Y âª Z)) cases h.right with | inl (g : x â Y) =&gt; exact Or.inl â¨h.left,gâ© | inr (g : x â Z) =&gt; exact Or.inr â¨h.left,gâ© Â· intro (h : x â (X âª Y) â© (X â© Z)) cases h with | inl (g : X â© Y) =&gt; exact â¨g.left,Or.inl g.rightâ© | inr (g : X â© Z) =&gt; exact â¨g.left,Or.inr g.rightâ© . In place of an apply Or.elim, we have used the cases tactic. This tactic creates different proof goals for each way there is to build the term. In our case, h.right : x â Y âª Z which is definitionally equivalent to x â Y â¨ x â Z. There are two ways to make a proof of an or-statement: either you have a proof of the left and use .inl or you have a proof the right and use .inr. These constructors are the labels for the two branches of the cases. Note that cases comes with additional syntax: with and the | to label the branches. Here is an example with the use of cases for the existential quantifer. variable (I U : Type) variable (X Y : I â Set U) example (h : â (i:I), X i â© Y i = â) : BigInter X â© BigInter Y = â := by set_extensionality x Â· intro (g : x â BigInter X â© BigInter Y) cases h with | intro (i : I) (gâ : X i â© Y i = â) =&gt; have gâ : x â X i := g.left i have gâ : x â Y i := g.right i have gâ : x â X i â© Y i := by rw [gâ] exact fun h =&gt; False.elim h exact gâ â¨gâ,gââ© Â· exact fun h =&gt; False.elim h .

    "content": "In a debate or a courtroom, there are usually two opposing sides. One is arguing for $A$ and the other is arguing for not $A$. In propositional logic, we introduce a symbol in the place of not: negation. It is denoted by $\\neg$. Given a formula $A$, then we can make a new one $\\neg A$. But what should be the rules of inference that mimic our arguments involving not? When have I established not of a statement? What does knowing the negation of a statement allow me to conclude? . One common pattern is to start an argument with $A$ and reason until you reach something that is clearly not true. This leads us to also introduce a symbol $\\bot$ which plays the role of false or âthis is crazyâ. Then we can formalize our pattern of argument via the following introduction rule for $\\neg$ . Given an argument assuming $A$ that leads to an absurdity, then we can conclude $\\neg A$. To eliminate $\\neg$ we have . If both $\\neg A$ and $A$ hold, then this is absurd. What are the rules for introducing and eliminating $\\bot$? We actually just saw the $\\bot$-introduction above â it doubles as the $\\neg$-elimination rule. The elimination rule is very general. Once we have established $\\bot$, then we are free to reach any conclusion. Letâs do another example to see how our rules of deduction interact. Example. Letâs establish \\(\\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg (A \\lor B)\\) . Recall this is shorthand for $ \\vdash (\\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg(A \\lor B))$. In words, this says we can establish $ \\neg A \\land \\neg B \\to \\neg (A \\lor B)$ with no assumptions. Proof. (Expand to view) If we want to establish a conclusion of the form $X \\to Y$ then we will want to introduce $\\to$. To do that we need to provide a deduction of the form $$ X \\vdash Y $$ In our case, we want to fill in the details for $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B \\vdash \\neg(A \\lor B) $$ Now our goal is of the form $\\neg Z$ so we want to introduce $\\neg$. To do that, we need to supply a proof of $\\bot$ from $Z$. We have reduced to establishing $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, A \\lor B \\vdash \\bot $$ We could combine $A$ and $\\neg A$, if we had them, to got $\\bot$. The same holds for $B$ and $\\neg B$. ee can eliminate $\\neg A \\land \\neg B$ into either $\\neg A$ or $\\neg B$. For $A \\lor B$ elimination, we need proofs of desired conclusion, here $\\bot$, one with $A$ $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, A \\vdash \\bot $$ and one with $B$ $$ \\neg A \\land \\neg B, B \\vdash \\bot $$ The proofs of these are quicker. Putting everything together, we get the following natural deduction proof. In step${}^0$, we cancel the assumption $\\neg A \\land \\neg B$ to introduce $\\to$. In step${}^1$, we cancel the assumption $A \\lor B$ to introduce $\\neg (A \\lor B)$ since our conclusion is $\\bot$. Finally the steps${}^2$, we cancel $A$ and $B$ using or elimination. The numerical labels are convenient to keep track of the cancellations. Note that all assumptions are cancelled. &#9632; . Ok so what is the value of this result? It gives a method of proof that holds no matter how we interpret $A$ and $B$. For example, if we say $A$ is âit is hot outâ and $B$ is âit is rainingâ, then we can interpret the above as saying âif I know that the either it is not hot out or it is not raining, then I can conclude that it is not both hot and sunnyâ. Each of formula that we can prove symbolically is an argument pattern that can be applied in any context. ",

Given two sets $X$ and $Y$ we can make a new one whose elements are those which come from $X$ or from $Y$ \\(X \\cup Y := \\lbrace z \\mid z \\in X \\text{ or } z \\in Y \\rbrace\\) . For example, if $X = \\lbrace 0,2,4\\rbrace$ and $Y = \\lbrace 0,1,3\\rbrace$ then \\(X \\cup Y = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\) . Note that $X,Y \\subseteq X \\cup Y$. Intersections. We can instead ask for the elements that are in both $X$ and $Y$. \\(X \\cap Y := \\lbrace z \\mid z \\in X \\text{ and } z \\in Y \\rbrace\\) . For example, if $X = \\lbrace 0,2,4\\rbrace$ and $Y = \\lbrace 0,1,3\\rbrace$ then \\(X \\cap Y = \\{0\\}\\) . Note that $X \\cap Y \\subseteq X,Y$. Complements. Another sensible thing to ask is that $z \\in X$ but $z \\not \\in Y$ or vice versa. \\(X \\setminus Y := \\lbrace z \\in X \\mid z \\not \\in Y \\rbrace\\) . For example, if $X = \\lbrace 0,2,4\\rbrace$ and $Y = \\lbrace 0,1,3\\rbrace$ then \\(X \\setminus Y = \\{2,4\\}\\) . A special case is when $X = \\mathcal U$. Then we write \\(X^c := \\mathcal U \\setminus X\\) Note that $X \\setminus Y \\subseteq X$. Unions, intersections, and complements can be understood with Venn diagrams. Products. The Cartesian product of sets $X$ and $Y$, denote $X \\times Y$ is \\(X \\times Y := \\lbrace (x,y) \\mid x \\in X \\text{ and } y \\in Y \\rbrace\\) Its elements consists of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ whose first entry is an element of $X$ and whose second is an element of $Y$. Two ordered pairs $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are equal if and only if their components are equal $x_1=x_2$ and $y_1=y_2$. For example, if $X = \\lbrace 0,2,4\\rbrace$ and $Y = \\lbrace 0,1,3\\rbrace$ then \\(X \\times Y = \\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,3),(2,0),(2,1),(2,3),(4,0),(4,1),(4,3)\\}\\) . We often use a line to represent $\\mathbb{R}$. The plane represents $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Power sets. Given a set $X$ we can form the set whose elements are all subsets of $X$. This called the power set of $X$ and is denoted by $\\mathcal P(X)$. For example if $X = \\lbrace 0,2,4 \\rbrace$, then \\(\\mathcal P(X) = \\lbrace \\varnothing, \\lbrace 0 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 2 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 4 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 0,2 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 0,4 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 2,4 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 0,2,4 \\rbrace \\rbrace\\) . Families of sets. Unions, intersections, and products are binary operations on sets: they take two sets and make new one. We can upgrade these a bit. A family of sets is a set of sets indexed by a set. We used set a lot there. More precisely, we have a indexing set $I$ and for each element $i \\in I$, we have a set $X_i$. Then \\(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} X_i := \\lbrace x \\mid x \\in X_i \\text{ for some } i \\in I \\rbrace \\\\ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} X_i := \\lbrace x \\mid x \\in X_i \\text{ for all } i \\in I \\rbrace\\) . We can also for the infinite product $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ whose elements are functions $f : I \\to \\mathcal U$ with $f(i) \\in X_i$ for each $i$. For example, letâs take $X_n = [0,1/(n+1)) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ where $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is our indexing set. Then, \\(\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X_n = [0,1) \\\\ \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X_n = \\lbrace 0 \\rbrace\\) One can understand $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} [0,1/(n+1))$ as half-infinite sequences of real numbers \\(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,\\ldots,x_m,\\ldots\\) where $0 \\leq x_n &lt; 1/(n+1)$.

Proof. (Expand to view) To show that two sets are equal we show that every element of one is an element of the other and vice-versa. Assume that $x \\in (X \\cap Y) \\cup (X \\setminus Y)$. Then either $x \\in X \\cap Y$ or $x \\in X \\setminus Y$. We argue in each case. If $x \\in X \\cap Y$, then $x \\in X$ and $x \\in Y$ by definition. Thus, $x \\in X$. If $x \\in X \\setminus Y$, then $x \\in X$ and $x \\not \\in X$. So $x \\in X$. In both cases, we conclude that $x \\in X$ overall. Now we argue in the other direction. Assume that $x \\in X$. Then either $x \\in Y$ or $x \\not \\in Y$. In the case that $x \\in Y$, we have $x \\in X \\cap Y$. In the case that $x \\not \\in Y$, we have $X \\setminus Y$. In both cases, we can conclude that $x \\in (X \\cap Y) \\cup (X \\setminus Y)$. &#9632; . Here is another one. Theorem. Let $X, Y$, and $Z$ be sets. Assume that $X \\cap Y = \\varnothing$. Then, \\((X \\times Z) \\cap (Y \\times Z) = \\varnothing\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Let's show that $(X \\times Z) \\cap (Y \\times Z)$ has no elements. Assume that $(u,v) \\in (X \\times Z) \\cap (Y \\times Z)$. Then, since $(u,v) \\in X \\times Z$, we have by definition $u \\in X$ and $v \\in Z$. Since $(u,v) \\in Y \\times Z$, we have $u \\in Y$ and $v \\in Z$. Thus, $u \\in X \\cap Y = \\varnothing$. We have element of the empty set which is a contradiction. Thus, one of our assumptions must be false. Here there must be no such element $(u,v)$. In other words, $(X \\times Z) \\cap (Y \\times Z)$ has no elements. From extensionality of sets, since it has the same elements as the empty set it must be $\\varnothing$ itself. &#9632; . ",

    "content": "There are now two distinct categories of validity of a logical statement. | Can we find a (natural deduction) proof $X \\vdash Y$? | For any truth assignment that makes $X \\mapsto T$, must $Y \\mapsto T$? | . Finding a proof is an explicit set of moves to go from $X$ to $Y$ while truth assignments are somewhat external to $X$ and $Y$ but it turns out that the these two notion are closely related. As such we will given the second notion some notation, we will write $X \\models Y$ if for any truth assignment whenever $X \\mapsto T$ then $Y \\mapsto T$ also. We can check this via a truth table. Example. Letâs take \\(X = (A \\to B) \\land A \\ , \\ Y = B\\) . Then we have . | $A$ | $B$ | $(A \\to B) \\land A$ | . | $T$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $T$ | $F$ | $F$ | . | $F$ | $T$ | $T$ | . | $F$ | $F$ | $F$ | . and can see that when $B$ is true so is $(A \\to B) \\land A$. So \\((A \\to B) \\land A \\models B\\) . But, we also know that \\((A \\to B) \\land A \\vdash B\\) from the proof . The proof above is very close to $\\to$ elimination. Indeed, that is the last set. It is easy to see that \\((A \\to B), A \\models B\\) . This means that whenever we apply $\\to$ elimination, we also have $\\models$ at that step in the proof. We come to our first real mathematical theorem. Theorem. Let $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ and $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$ be collections of formulas in proposition logic. If we know that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\vdash Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) then \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\models Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) . With the example above and the accompanying discussion, this might not be so surprising. A natural deduction proof is built from the elimination and introduction rules listed in the previous sections. One just needs to check that all of these rules donât break $\\models$. At the moment, we content ourselves with this sketch of a proof. It should be enough to leaving your favoring the validity of the theorem but it falls short of a full mathematical proof. This theorem goes by the name of soundness of propositional logic. But, wait, there is more. Theorem. Let $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ and $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$ be collections of formulas in proposition logic. If we know that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\models Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) then \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_r \\vdash Y_1, \\ldots, Y_s\\) . In fact, you can somehow conjure a proof from the aether just from knowing whenever $X_1,\\ldots,X_r$ get assigned $T$, then so does $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_s$. This is usually called the completeness of propositional logic. A proof this result is beyond the scope of the course but it depends on using the law of the excluded middle (or reductio ad absurdum as they are equivalent. One approach is to break it into a giant collection of cases coming from $A \\lor \\neg A$ for each variable $A$.) . Theorems in mathematics ideally should provide deeper understanding and new tools to address old questions. One question we havenât really broached but it immediate: how do I know when it is impossible to prove $Y$ with assumptions $X$? . Going straight from the defintion of a natural deduction proof, we would have to test all possible combinations of introduction/elimination rules. Not great. However, from soundness, if we can find a single truth assignment with $X \\mapsto T$ but $Y \\mapsto F$, then we can immediately conclude that $X \\not \\vdash Y$, ie that it is impossible to prove $Y$ from $X$. Example. Letâs show that we cannot prove $\\neg A \\land B \\to C$ from $A \\to B, \\neg C$. Letâs take $A \\mapsto F, B \\to T$, and $C \\to F$. Then \\(A \\to B, \\neg C \\mapsto T\\) while \\(\\neg A \\land B \\to C \\mapsto F\\) If we had $A \\to B, C \\vdash \\neg A \\land B \\to C$, then from the theorem above we could conclude that $A \\to B, C \\vdash \\neg A \\land B \\to C$. We have arrived now at an absurdity. Our calculation shows that $X \\not \\models Y$ but our argument shows that $X \\models Y$. We might be worried for second but then we remember the argument started out with an assumption: that we had a proof! The only way to avoid the absurdity for there not be a proof. In this example, you can see the basic moves in propositional logic being employed in a real-life mathematical example. ",

    "content": "In propositional logic, we start with variables, like $A,B,$ or $C$ as have been our defaults. These are meant to represent statements which can either be true or false. But, it is very common for a statement to depend on additional data before we can check its truth or falsity. For example, âthe dog has four feetâ. Is this true or false? . Well, it depends on which dog we are talking about. We can think of âdogâ as a variable which when filled with a concrete dog makes the statement a proposition. A common, more mathematical, class of examples are statements of about numbers. Recall that the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ are $0,1,2,3,\\ldots$. Definition. Given two natural numbers $n$ and $m$, we say $n$ divides $m$ if there is some other natural number $c$ such that \\(m = cn\\) If $n$ divides $m$, we write $n \\mid m$. If $n$ does not divide $m$, we write $n \\nmid m$. For example, $2$ divides $4$ but $3$ does not divide $4$. The statement $m$ divides $n$ can be true or false depending on the values we have for $m$ and $n$. Another important possible property of a (natural) number. Definition. A natural number $p$ is prime if . | $p \\neq 1$, i.e. $p$ is not $1$, and | whenever there is another natural number $d$ with $d \\mid n$, then we must have $d = 1$ or $d = p$. | . So $13$ is prime but $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$ is not because it is divisible by $3$ and $5$. The truth of the statement, $n$ is prime, depends on the value of $n$ itself. In each of these examples, we have collection of variables, dogs or numbers, and statements whose truth are predicated on value of the variable. Predicate, or first order, logic is an extention of propositional logic meant to model these examples. The basic building blocks are called predicates and usually denoted like $A(x), B(x,z)$, or $C(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$. Here $x$ and $A$ play different roles. The symbol $x$ is a stand in for our variables and $A$ is like a proposition but it depends on $x$ in general. One way to understand this semantically is as a function $A : \\alpha \\to \\text{Prop}$ where $x \\in \\alpha$ is our collection of variables and $A$ is a function which hands back a proposition whenever an choice from $\\alpha$ is inputed. If we have a regular old proposition, we can think of it a predicate that does not change as we vary the input. In this way, we can start to embed propositional logic in predicate logic. Continuing, we add it the familiar connectives. If $A(x,y)$ and $B(z)$ are predicates, then we make new formulas using . | implication: $A(x,y) \\to B(z)$ | negation: $\\neg B(z)$ | conjunction: $A(x,y) \\land B(z)$ | disjunction: $A(x,y) \\lor B(z)$ | bi-implication: $A(x,y) \\leftrightarrow B(z)$. | . Like with propositional logic, we can keep joining up formulas using these connectives to make bigger and bigger new formulas. ",

    "content": "If we stopped here, our resulting logic would look like propositional logic with just a bigger set of propositions coming from varying the inputs. The richness of allowing propositions to depend on variables is that we can naturally ask about which values make a predicate true. Which dogs have four legs? All of them? Some of them? None of them? . To capture these sentiments, we introduce two new symbols into the game: . | the universal quantifier: $\\forall$ | the existential quantifier : $\\exists$ | . The universal quantifier is commonly called a âfor allâ and the existential quantifier a âthere existsâ. Before we gives the symbolic rules for writing our formulas in predicate logic using $\\forall$ and $\\exists$. Letâs look at quantifying statements in the realm of numbers. Definition. A number $n$ is even if $2 \\mid n$ and is odd if $2 \\nmid n$. Clearly any number is either divisible by $2$ or not. So the following is a true statement: for all $n$, $n$ is even or $n$ is odd. We could look at the statement: for all $n$, $n$ is prime. This would be false as we have seen there are values of $n$, like $15$, that are not prime numbers. The following is true: there exists some $n$ such that $n$ is prime. Since $n=2$ is prime, we have at least one $n$ which is prime. Using for all, there exists, and their negations, we can capture our questions about the quantity of values making the predicate formula true. Given a predicate of the form $B(y,z)$ we say that $y$ and $z$ are free variables. We can attach to each free variable at most one quantifier. For example, $\\exists y ~ \\forall z~ B(y,z)$ is a valid new formula as are $\\exists z~ B(y,z)$ or $\\forall y~ \\forall z~ B(y,z)$. Note that each quantifier comes with a variable label identifying the variable we are quantifying over. Once we quantify over a free variable, it becomes a bound variable. In general, given a formula in predicate logic with a free variable $x$ we can form a new formula by quantifying, using either $\\forall$ or $\\exists$, over it. ",

We can universally quantify over $n$ in the first one and get a true statement but not so with the second. We see being able to reason about inputs being the same or different is desired when our truth statement depend on those inputs. We therefore introduce one more new symbol: $=$, equality. We can use $=$ to make new predicates like $x = y$ or $\\neg(x = y)$. Taking everything together we can make formula like: . | $\\forall x~ \\exists ~y (A(x,y) \\to (x = y))$ | $\\exists x~ \\exists y~ \\exists z~ (\\neg(x = y) \\land \\neg(y=z) \\land \\neg(x=z) \\land B(x,y,z))$ or | $\\forall x~ (A(x,y) \\to \\exists z~ B(z))$ | . For convenience of write, we often bundle together multiple variables bound under the same quantifer. For example, we write $\\exists x~ y$ when we mean $\\exists x~ \\exists y$. And we adopt standard conventions for implicit parentheses where $\\exists$ and $\\forall$ bind more closely that the previous binary quantifiers. ",

So formally, a function is injective if it satisfies \\(\\forall a_1, a_2, a_1 \\neq a_2 \\to f(a_1) \\neq f(a_2)\\) . Example. The function \\(f : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\\\ n \\mapsto n + 1\\) is injective. For, if $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $n_1 + 1 = n_2 + 1$. Adding $-1$ to both sides, gives $n_1 = n_2$. In checking injectivity of the previous example, we encountered the contrapositive $f(a_1) = f(a_2) \\to a_1 = a_2$ which is also often taken as the definition of injectivity.

Injectivity can be viewed as saying $f: A \\to B$ injects a copy of $A$ into $B$. Definition. A function $f: A \\to B$ is surjective if, for any $b$ in $B$, there is some $a$ with $f(a) = b$. Formally, \\(\\forall b, \\exists a, f(a) = b\\) . Returning to our two examples above, we see $n \\mapsto n+1$ is also surjective. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, since $f(m-1) = m$, we have an element mapping to $m$. Thus, $f$ is surjective. If we change the domain and codomain to $\\mathbb{N}$, $n \\mapsto n + 1$ is no longer surjective . def Surjective (f : Î± â Î²) : Prop := â b, â a, f a = b example : Â¬ Surjective f := by intro (h : Surjective f) have â¨m,gâ© : â n, n + 1 = 0 := h 0 -- we use that 0 is never equal to n + 1 for n : Nat exact Nat.succ_ne_zero m g . The function $n \\mapsto n^2$ is not surjective since there is no integer that solves $n^2 = -1$. Often one wants to understand the totality of $b$âs for which there is some $a$ such that $f(a) = b$. This is called the range (or image) of $f$. Note the range and codomain are distinct in general. Indeed, \\(f : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\\\ n \\mapsto n + 1\\) is surjective to the range equals the codomain. But each integer is also a real number so the function \\(f : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\\\ n \\mapsto n + 1\\) is also well-defined. Even though, as is common, we used the same notation for the two functions, they are not equal as function because they have two different codomains. We can think of a surjective function $f: A \\to B$ as way of covering $B$ with $A$ using the rule $f$. We can combine the two notions in a single one. Definition. A function $f: A \\to B$ is bijective if it is both injective and surjective. In Lean, . def Bijective (f : Î± â Î²) : Prop := Injective f â§ Surjective f . Our first example, $n \\mapsto n+1$, is bijective. Bijectivity can be rephrased as \\(\\forall b, \\exists ! a, f(a) = b\\) For any $b$, there is exactly one value $a$ satisfying $f(a) = b$. Injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity are preserved under composition in the following sense. Theorem. Let $f : A \\to B$ and $g : B \\to C$ be functions. | Suppose $f$ and $g$ are injective, Then $g \\circ f$ is also injective. | Suppose $f$ and $g$ are surjective. Then $g \\circ f$ is also surjective. | Suppose $f$ and $g$ are bijective. Then $g \\circ f$ is also bijective. | . Proof. (Expand to view) Assume that $f$ and $g$ are injective. If $g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))$, then since $g$ is injective we know that $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$. But since $f$ is injective, we have $a_1 = a_2$. Thus, $g \\circ f$ is injective. Assume that $f$ and $g$ are surjective. Then for a $c$ there is some $b$ with $g(b) = c$ since $g$ is sujective. There is also some $a$ with $f(a) = b$ since $f$ is surjective. Thus, we have $a$ with $g(f(a)) = c$ and $g \\circ f$ is surjective. Finally if both $f$ and $g$ are bijections, then, by definition, they are both injective and surjective. We have just shown that $g \\circ f$ is then injective and surjective or is a bijection. &#9632; . We can also detect injectivity or surjectivity using a composition. Theorem. Let $f : A \\to B$ and $g : B \\to C$ be functions. | If $g \\circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective. | If $g \\circ f$ is surjective, then $g$ is surjective. | . Letâs give a proof of this in Lean. theorem comp_inj (f : Î± â Î²) (g : Î² â Î³) (h : Injective (g â f)) : Injective f := by -- assume we have two values with equal image intro (aâ : Î±) (aâ : Î±) (hâ : f aâ = f aâ) -- apply g to equal arguments yields equal outputs have : g (f aâ) = g (f aâ) := congrArg g hâ exact h this theorem comp_surj (f : Î± â Î²) (g : Î² â Î³) (h : Surjective (g â f)) : Surjective g := by -- take some and try to solve g b = c for some b intro (c : Î³) -- take the a satisfying g (f a) = c and the proof of equality have â¨a,hââ© : â a, g (f a) = c := h c -- the b we want is f a and the same proof of equality works exact â¨f a, hââ© .

Equality, divisibility, and $ &lt; $ are all transitive. Definition. We say that $\\sim$ is total if \\(\\forall~ x,y, x \\sim y \\lor y \\sim x\\) Total relations are ones where we can compare every pair, one way or another.

A where keyword allows you to introduce unknown results and use them if you provide their definition and proof after the where statement. Letâs look at some specific properties of division.

More formally, we want to know about jutisfying \\(\\neg \\neg A \\vdash A\\) Can this be done using the rules so far? . Unfortunately, nothing in our rules so far will allow us establish this. Adding this rule to our existing system yields some very useful conclusions. For example, given $\\neg A \\vdash \\bot$, we already knew we could establish $\\vdash \\neg \\neg A$ but now we also have $\\vdash A$. The process of establishing $A$ by assuming $A$ doesnât hold and arguing to a contradiction goes by the Reductio ad absurdum (RAA) or proof by contradiction. Another well-known conclusion is the Law of the Excluded Middle which is just \\(A \\lor \\neg A\\) In other words, no matter what $A$ is either $A$ holds or it is doesnât. You might take a moment and think this an immutable law of reality. Our day-to-day experience definitely leads us to think this. But reality in general is more complicated. Think of Schrodingerâs cat. Is the cat alive or not alive in the box? What is the state of the unobserved wave function? .

    "content": "With a richer language of symbols comes more rules that mimic how we argue about truth. Here we extend the rules of inference from propositonal logic to include rules for quantifiers and equality. Introduction and elimination rules model how we use formulas as assumptions or conclude then as goals in arguments. How would we conclude that something is true for all values of a variable? Letâs call our formula $A(x).$ Well, if we can establish $A(x)$ without imposing any âconditionsâ on $x$, we should be free to conclude $\\forall x~ A(x)$. In particular, we should not have any hypotheses floating around that depend on $x$ themselves. For example, if we assumed that $4 \\mid n$, then we could conclude that $n$ is even. But it would make no sense to conclude that $n$ is even for all $n$. Our standing assumption placed conditions on $n$. Following this idea, we use the following introduction rule: . but only if $x$ is not free in any uncancelled hypotheses at this step. Elimination works very much in the reverse. Given a proof of $\\forall x~ A(x)$, we get a proof of $A(x)$ itself. A proof of a formula $A(x)$ with free variable behaves like a proof the formula of the universal quantification over it $\\forall x~ A(x)$. We can be a more general . where $t$ is any other term available to us. You can think of this as a useful change of variables. However, we need to be careful about collisions of names â we need to make sure that $t$ is itself does not involve any variables bound elsewhere in $A(x)$. For example, if we have the formula $\\forall x~ \\exists~y \\neg(x = y)$ and we try to eliminate to $\\exists y~ \\neg(y = y)$ by taking $t=y$ we quickly run into problems. ",

Again our switch from $t$ to $x$ allows for convenient change of variables. We next come to the existential elimination. It is a good point to stop and make a useful analogy between the pair $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ and the pair $\\land$ and $\\lor$. Suppose we our variable could only take a finite set of values $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$. Then saying $\\forall x~ A(x)$ is true is equivalent to saying that the big conjunction \\(A(x_1) \\land A(x_2) \\land \\cdots \\land A(x_n)\\) is true. Similarly, saying that $\\exists x~ A(x)$ is true is equivalent to the big disjunction \\(A(x_1) \\lor A(x_2) \\lor \\cdots \\lor A(x_n)\\) being true. Via this analogy, in the general setting, $\\forall$ can be viewed as akin to an âinfinite andâ and $\\exists$ can be viewed as an âinfinite orâ.

In addition to being a term in the (big) type of Prop, X is itself a type whose terms are proofs of X. We can of course declare we have a proof (without providing one) by saying . variable (A : Prop) variable (h : A) . But far more important for us is producing proofs! . Before we look at some basic examples, letâs introduce two new keywords for Lean: example and theorem. Both of these tell Lean that we want to produce a proof for a particular proposition. Here are some examples: . variable (A : Prop) example : A := sorry theorem bigOne : A := sorry . The main difference between example and theorem is that theorem expects a name whereas example does not. Each of these is telling Lean that I am going to provide a proof of A. This is why we end the statement with : A. It is informing Lean the type of the coming proof. The proof goes after :=. sorry is a special command that decreases the volume of the complaints from Lean that we did not actually provide a proof. If we remove sorry, we notice that the message is in red now: unexpected end of input. Messages like these from the infoview pane are meant to be helpful in constructing our proofs but they can be cryptic. A good rule is to step back a little and meditate on the error message in the context of the question. In general, we cannot produce a proof out of nothing except for situations. Even so, they are instructive to investigate. Suppose I want to establish $A \\vdash A$. This is trivial in propositional logic: I have $A$ so I have $A$. How does this look in Lean? . For examples/theorems, we can put the assumptions on the left-hand side of the semi-colon. example (h : A) : A := sorry . This reads as: âassume I have a proof h of A and I want to prove Aâ. A completed proof is: . example (h : A) : A := h . You are providing the assumed proof of A as the desired proof of A. A formula we can always prove is $\\top$.

This is done as . variable (A B : Prop) example (f : A â B) (h : A) : B := f h . What is going on here? h is a proof of A as before and f is a proof of A â B. What is a proof of A â B? Well, one way to understand it is as a way to turn a proof of A into a proof B. We generally call such things functions. By placing f h, we are saying âfeed h into f and use the outputâ. A more common way to say it is that we applied f to h. Application of f of h is how $\\to$-elimination is implemented in Lean. Next we look at $\\to$-introduction. For example, how would we finish the following? . variable (A : Prop) example : A â A := sorry . This difference between this example and . example (h : A) : A := h . is the exactly the elimination rule for implication. We want to make a function f : A â A which mimics our intitution that given a proof h : A that we can output that given proof to get a proof of A. The syntax for doing so is seen below in the completed example. variable (A : Prop) example : A â A := fun (h:A) =&gt; h . fun tells Lean that a function is coming (h : A) specifies the input (and its type). The arrow =&gt; separates the input from the output. Strictly speaking this is not the implication introduction rule but it plays an important part. variable {A B : Prop} theorem superProof (h : A) : B := sorry example : A â B := fun (h : A) =&gt; superProof h . We can treat the (nonexistent) proof of our theorem as a function. But you may have noticed the braces { A B : Prop }. When we declare (A : Prop), Lean adds it as an assumption to all examples/theorems in our file. So really superProof has the form . theorem {A B : Prop} superProof (h : A) : B := sorry . Using the parentheses (A B : Prop) tells Lean that I want A and B to also be (explicit) inputs to superProof. (When we saying variable to Lean, it really goes all out.) . Using the braces {A B : Prop} tells Lean âyou figure out A and Bâ from the other information. Which is can do in the case of our example from the desired type is A â B. ",

In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason.

I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I donât mind letting you work independently at all. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation:Â Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 5 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic.Â If symptoms persist on the fifth day, then the isolation must be extended to 10 days. What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through theÂ Student Ombudsman. Â Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete theÂ COVID-19 Student Report FormÂ and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.Â  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

    "content": "We delve much deeper into propositional (and other kinds of) logic. While we will talk about one more form of logic (first order or predicate logic), we want to get to using our new logical skills on mathematical questions. As such, letâs end the module on propositional logic with a list of useful and/or well-known provable formulas. Below $A,B,C$ are general formula. | \\(A \\land B \\leftrightarrow B \\land A\\) When we can exchange the placement of an operation taking two inputs (binary operation), then we say it is commutative. This is saying that $\\land$ is commutative (up to bi-implication). | $\\lor$ is commutative : \\(A \\lor B \\leftrightarrow B \\lor A\\) | \\((A \\land B) \\land C \\leftrightarrow A \\land (B \\land C)\\) When we have three arguments for a binary and consume them in different orders (apply it to 1 and 2 then the result to 3 vs apply it to 2 and 3 first then the result to 1 while keeping the order of the placements) without affecting the final output, then we say the operation is associative. So here $\\land$ is asssociative. | You can distribute $\\land$ over $\\lor$: \\(A \\land (B \\lor C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\land B) \\lor (A \\land C)\\) | You can also distribute $\\lor$ over $\\land$: \\(A \\lor (B \\land C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\lor B) \\land (A \\lor C)\\) | \\[(A \\to (B \\to C)) \\leftrightarrow (A \\land B \\to C)\\] | Transitivity of implication: \\((A \\to B) \\to ((B \\to C) \\to (A \\to C))\\) | \\[((A \\lor B) \\to C) \\leftrightarrow (A \\to C) \\lor (B \\to C)\\] | \\[\\neg (A \\lor B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg A \\land \\neg B\\] | \\(\\neg (A \\land B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg A \\lor \\neg B\\) | \\[\\neg (A \\to B) \\leftrightarrow A \\land \\neg B\\] | \\[\\neg A \\to (A \\to B)\\] | \\((\\neg A \\lor B) \\leftrightarrow (A \\to B)\\) | \\[\\neg(A \\leftrightarrow \\neg A)\\] | \\[(A \\to B) \\leftrightarrow (\\neg B \\to \\neg A)\\] | \\((A \\to (B \\lor C)) \\to ((A \\to B) \\lor (A \\to C))\\) | If $B \\leftrightarrow C$, then for any $A$ we have . | \\[A \\lor B \\leftrightarrow A \\lor C\\] | \\[A \\land B \\leftrightarrow A \\land C\\] | \\[A \\to B \\leftrightarrow A \\to C\\] | . | . Each of the above can provide a useful logical shortcut when in the midst of a mathematical argument. ",
