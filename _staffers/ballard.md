I am a Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.sc.edu/) at the [University of South Carolina](http://www.sc.edu/).  

I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. 

For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the [teaching](https://www.matthewrobertballard.com/teaching) page. 
As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. 

In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference.
